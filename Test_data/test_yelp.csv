I love the baked cream bolos and the coconut cream/sesame buns there!  (I toast them up in the toaster oven before eating, so they're warm and very flaky!)  I visited AA Wholesome once (it was getting dark out), after shopping at Mekong, and found the baker busy churning out fresh-baked pastries.  I was looking for something coconut-ty, and she recommended a fresh-from-the-oven MINI coconut tart-- I'm not kidding, it was just around 2.5 inches in diameter.  It was tasty, and definitely delivered the coconut fix I wanted, but at $1.45 a pop (15 cents higher than bakery prices, but significantly bigger than those sold at the bakery), it was price-y.  I wouldn't order it again.  The bolos and coconut/sesame buns are priced similarly, but at least I can stretch them out to two servings per bun.

Bakery looked clean and organized, and the pastries are baked fresh everyday.  Day-old pastries can be bought at a discount, so come in before they close for deals on your favorite stuff-- I haven't been lucky though, as none of my faves stay long on the shelves.

But the wait for a drink at the dark dank bar was at least 20 minutes. 

I spied Mike's pitcher from a few minutes earlier and thought that would be a better deal since it took so freaking long to even get the attention of the bartender.  The bartender chick snapped at me and screamed ""No more pitchers!"" when she had just served one a few minutes earlier, so I had to settle for carrying around a bunch of PBR cans like an effing high schooler.  Shoot, if I knew I would be lugging beers in my pockets I would have made alternate plans.  I'm not above bringin a flask. 

The crowd is kind of all over the place, like Glam and Homme, except here it skews more indie punk rock or wannabe indie punk rock. I love me some divey bar, so I was looking forward to a decent time at Rogue.  That bar experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  Cheap ass drinks couldn't make up for it. I might be back, but I'm in no hurry.

The bar itself is dark and dirty (bathrooms vie for the sickest in town, parking lot vies for smallest in town), and I'm ok with that, but with the crappy bar service, what would the saving grace be?  The people and the music.  Seeing a dozen or so friends (including Bonnie and Michael) randomly converge on this place after a concert rocked in my book.

The vegetables, herbs and fruits only survive if they are watered, given nutrients and protected in severe weather. In addition, the best of gardens have a green thumbed gardener overseeing the entire operation. The Phoenix Public Market reminds me of a cherished homegrown garden.

Just as if I was walking through a friend's house into their backyard of homegrown products, I walked into the Phoenix Public Market and immediately took in a whiff of fresh herbs, produce and products welcoming me inside. Freshly picked fruits and vegetables sat in the middle cooler and dairy, more produce, meat and other refrigerated treats such as hummus lingered in the left-hand cooler. In the back cooler, locally owned products such as Sweet Republic made their home in the freezer and then throughout the rest of the shop, locally owned delights sat on the shelves. There's everything from Desert Smoke BBQ sauce and Tracey Dempsey Originals, to locally owned cracker companies and plenty of dairy. It's easy to spend awhile exploring each and every product.

Now it's time to pick from the ""garden"" and talk about the restaurant portion of the market. Here they make everything including breakfast, salads, sandwiches and plenty of baked goods. Today I went for the fresh Turkey sandwich. My-oh-my was it delicious. Freshly roasted turkey hugged chewy wheat bread and fruit jam as well as a herb mayo spread kept the turkey and bread together. It's a simple sandwich but something about the combination of ingredients makes it much more than just simple. It tasted like a garden on my plate especially with the tomatoes and lettuce that accompanied it.

After my meal, I continued to sit in the grocery store and do some work while looking out on the Downtown buildings and beautiful vines growing on the market's patio. For a split second I forgot I was in 113 degree weather in Phoenix and pretended like I was sitting in a cool 75 degree San Francisco day; or better yet, a fresh garden overlooking an ocean. Finally, I finished my day with a meeting inside the coffee shop (Royal at the Market) and before I left, I browsed the outdoor Public Market that goes on every Wednesday night. It was a wonderful afternoon and the reason I love to live local so much.

This is clearly someplace where you can spend the entire day daydreaming and imagining you're in a garden. It's a pleasant atmosphere to do work in. The staff is extremely friendly, but they let people do their work and chat when guests are ready for a conversation.

The hummus was good, but certainly not the ""best in the valley"" as our waiter purported. I ended up adding salt.

My ""LTL"" (veggie version of the BLT) was very bland. I added salt and that didn't even help. My bread was slightly burned and the potato hash that they gave as a side was cold, limp and you could tell it was burned during the cooking process.

The vegan pizza was also pretty boring. It was a combo of olive oil and red sauce. They could have spruced it up with some spices and made it really flavorful, but it definitely left me wanting for more.

I appreciate the charcoal water filtration system that helps eliminate ""water bottle waste"" but I don't know that charging $2 for the table is necessary.

The honey lemonade was good but gave me a tummy ache, and the nojito just had way too much going on (honey, lime, ginger, soda water, etc).

Our service was good, if not a little overbearing, otherwise I would give this place 2 stars. The food is boring and extremely overpriced. Our casual lunch turned into $50, and there was no alcohol involved.

Yep. This pretty much sums up our service at MB this past Sunday. Forgotten entrees. No ice bucket for the champagne. Drinks took forever, if indeed, they were remembered. Ketchup? Our beniets? Ugh! 

Formerly the FoodBar (remember that place, with the awful layout and crazy ordering procedure?), MB is a lovely French restaurant in the heart of Oldtown. We sat inside, luckily, as some Gen X Jewel type performer was on the patio ""singing"" and strumming her guitar. I heard just a few bars and wanted to stab my eye out with a hot fork. Fortunately the hustle and bustle inside perfectly drowned it out! 

The food was quite good. Not incredible. Beniets were undercooked a bit, but hey, we scarfed them down anyway. My eggs Benedict was fantastic; served with biscuits instead of English muffins. But no potatoes. No salad. No nothing on the side. Not even a garnish. Others seemed pleased with a burger, granola and an all American breakfast. 

Christine is right however, in that we were there to celebrate a birthday. Too bad much of our energy was used to flag down ANYONE who could help us. I swear I almost asked the lady sitting next to us to refill Rickie's coffee. God that would have been fun!

But just like Groupon, the voucher was about to expire so we stayed in June.  Did we get a $350 stay?  No, but it was for charity.

While the grounds are gorgeous and you cannot deny the impressive architecture, there are too many misses to for a luxury hotel.

First off, parking.  If I'm going to pay to self-park a half mile away in 110 degree heat, I might as well fork out a few extra dollars and pay the ridiculous $27/night for valet.  I understand parking fees in a city where space is at a premium, but this is Arizona.  This hotel, in particular, does not appear to be short on it.  Second, luggage handling and bell service.  We did not need these services, however, upon exiting our vehicle, it appeared the entire entrance was a chaotic mess.  Third, water.  Okay, charge me for Voss or Fiji, but you can't cough up a free bottle of your hotel branded water to guests that might be on the verge of heat exhaustion after making the trek from their car?  Even Holiday Inn Express gives me a free bottle, not to mention other Waldorf Astoria hotels I've stayed at.  Fourth,  while the restaurant prices seemed reasonable, the cafe prices were worse than any airport.  I suppose the restaurants are looking to draw in locals, but the cafe is only used by guests.  

As for the rooms, ours was spacious and the bathroom had been remodeled relatively recently.  But it was odd that certain fixtures (faucets and towel racks) had been replaced, but others were not (bathroom tissue holder).  The rest of the room, however, was in dire need of an update.  The furnishings were tired and worn.  The bed was comfy, however.  I was also disappointed that the balcony wall was so high you could not see the gardens below from the room at all or from the balcony itself unless you were standing.

While I would possibly stay again, in a different building, I'm not sure.  I got the impression this is a party hotel of sorts.

From the hand-written menu outside to the picturesque garden exterior, Cafe Monarch is a little gem in the heart of downtown Scottsdale.

It was a lovely late Saturday morning when we ate here, right at opening time (11 AM).  The menu for lunch is all $12.50 no matter what you get, with selections such as pork tenderloin, chicken breast, shrimp, and brie with fennel.  The last two selections are what my friend and I had.  The shrimp was excellent.  It was perfectly cooked, on crispy toasted bread covered with pesto.  There were also pieces of sweet pineapple, sliced cherry tomatoes, and chopped onion to add some more color and tropical flavor.  There was a massive amount of shrimp on the plate, which made this dish a tasty and very good deal.  My friend had the brie with fennel and puff pastry (My description of this, by the way, does not do the dish justice).  All the ingredients were well prepared and very good on their own, but for me, it wasn't as good as my shrimp dish.  

Drink selections include hot tea, coffee, and iced green or hibiscus tea ($3).  The hibiscus tea is very refreshing with a deep garnet color to the drink.  

Our total for 2 lunch dishes and 1 iced tea was a little over $30 including tax.  This establishment is cash only, so come prepared!

Or is it secret - like the Bat cave?  

In my teens and early to mid-20's I thought this place ROCKED!  I worked in a mall that had a location here and I loved having the excuse to make a trip.  A few months ago I mentioned to a friend that I hadn't been over there in a few years and she said we should meet for drinks at one of those spots that now surrounds it in a ""are you IN the mall or NEAR the mall"" kind of way.  I came after work on a casual Friday.  In jeans and a polo shirt I felt under dressed to be in the mall.  In a MALL!

I'd gotten there early so I had a good hour or so to scan the place for old time's sake and maybe grab a new shirt before happy hour.  I was so disappointed.  Sure, there were always some high end shops, but there had been some ""real"" places too.  (The one Gap does not count) Maybe I missed the ""I have a house payment - not a sugar daddy"" wing?  I'm totally willing to admit it if that was the case.  After all - I'd already walked in the wrong door...

Before I summarize here, let me mention that I never found a shirt.  Here's my problem.  I'm a plus sized gal.  I didn't need a tent store or anything, but I could use a Lane Bryant here and there.  Nothing.  Not one blessed plus sized store in the whole place.  I saw some women there who were my size and more.  Most of them were shopping with their skinny daughters.  Some of them SHOULD have been going up a size but were apparently determined to stay a single digit.  (Be afraid, be very afraid.)  Kinda killed my ""shopping"" mood.  

So here's the thing.  We know this place has an amazing assortment of shops to die for.  I will love the Coach store until I die - so I know this first hand.  But for a mall this size to have gone so strongly in one direction, and to leave a regular gal like me just looking at shoes, soaps and the bookstore - is kinda sad.

The inside is all black, but they spared us from the excessive black lights that illuminate your fabric softener making you feel like everyone can see your body is covered in dandruff. There's a big open dance floor that spans the length of the room along the bar leading to an outside patio.

We were allowed to sit in a velvet roped off VIP area, but told that we would only have to move if someone ""bought it."" We were soon to find out how unlikely that would be...

There were also beds outside and some decent bar-height seating near the balcony which made it pretty casual and relaxing and social. 

My biggest problem with the outside was that everyone was smoking (as young people all apparently do) and it felt just as smoky as the insides of smoky bars used to be before the smoking ban.

I ain't gonna lie. You can easily rack up a pretty lofty bill, especially when you're ordering wine by the glass and $9.50 appetizers that taste too good to be true. My fave has to be the Garlic Shrimp Pizza, though it was a tad too greasy. Also good: Baked Brie L' Orange and the Fruit/Cheese plate. 

Farrelli's offers a large drink selection, including featured cocktails and seasonal beers. But, for the wine lover, you'll be happily pleased to see their expansive wine list. You can buy by the glass or the bottle. Prices start at 7 and go up to 9.50 for their suggested Earthquake Cab. I had a glass of that (very good), as well as the Round Hill Cab, which I preferred. 

A movie will cost ya $8.50. But seriously, it's not the price that matters. It's the experience. 

Picture this: You place a simple phone call into Farrelli's and tell them you want to make a reservation for (insert time here) for (this many people here). They put your name on the list, then advise you to arrive 30 minutes before showing so they can seat you and take your order. You are welcome to arrive even sooner and take a seat in their bar, which boasts pictures of Hollywood stars, including the timeless Marilyn Monroe. 

The theater itself feels more like a larger lounge area, with a movie screen. You sit in comfortable leather chairs at a round table. 

Best thing of all? You can simply push a button during the movie and your server will answer. What is it that you needed? No worries. 

At the end of the movie, you get a bill, much like at a restaurant. You can split it up however you feel like it. My close friend said, ""Don't be alarmed by the bill."" Thanks for the warning, for between the three of us, it was $125 w/o tip. I guess every once in a while you just need to spoil yourself, right? 

If you go with someone (or a few someones) and you all can agree on a wine to order, I suggest ordering a bottle. It's the one piece of advice I'd bestow on anyone going here. Also, no need to dress to the 9's. This place will welcome you in jeans and chucks! 

Farrelli's is a great experience. I recommend it for everyone - friends, family, a date. The movies they offer here aren't new releases, but they manage.

Sat at the bar, since it was a Friday and I guess that's where people sit.  Went with Kirti for happy hour & just to chill.  Not only was the service great (I rarely had to ask for a refill), but the chef even came out to introduce herself.  The place wasn't too crowded yet, which was good, because that's another reason for all the attention.  Had to keep the worker bees busy!  
First thing we tried was the ribs appetizer.  They were falling off the bone and had an amazingly sticky-spicy-sweet sauce on them.  Also had the crab dip, which came with plantain chips.  I loooooooooove plantain chips.  Love.  
The pork tacos?  OMG.  O. M. G.  I took a couple home as leftovers and my mouth watered all night, thinking about those tacos.
For dessert, we had ""crack pie.""  I don't even know what was in it, but the crust was nutty, there was whipped cream, and it stuck to my teeth when I ate it.  And it was made from crack.  It HAD to be!!!!!!  The red velvet cupcake was also divine, but that crack pie...*sigh*

I'm typically not so much into chain restaurants but I've been to Yard House more than a handful of times and it's pretty consistent so I don't mind going every once in a while... the thing is, I now have a favorite item on the menu, it's the miso glazed sea bass.  When we went the other night, they were out... bummer!

Our server was fine- not the most friendly, but took decent care of us.  We were a party of 6, and I wasn't the only one planning on ordering the seabass... my aunt and I were both disappointed, but what can you do?  I ended up with the shrimp and vegetable terriyaki bowl and my aunt went with the tuna tartar appetizer and edamame.  Others at the table had the scallops, the turkey burger, a steak salad, and scallop entree... Few of us were drinking that night, but we managed to have a good meal.

The manager, Clem, came over to apologize for being out of seabass - that was appropriate; obviously, we knew it wasn't his fault, but the gesture was nice.  

In thinking about writing this review, I have to say that I lingered between 3 and 4 stars... I ended up giving just 3 because the Yard House has become just another chain restaurant in my eyes... nothing special, the same thing every time, just plain old average!

Sure, I'll be back for group meals, but I won't be rushing over on my own or on a date anytime soon. Go for a beer, go to watch a game, go to listen to some classic rock and have an average meal... and if you like seabass and it's in stock, go for it!",review,8cL7aJVKTYmLguzXEAS3Lw

I went during the busy lunch hour, so I shouldn't have been surprised by the crowd.  But it took a really long time to wait in line and place my order.  Good thing I was in good company - Marcus D can make the time go by anywhere... (you know he's good when he can capture my fiance's attention even with his major ADD).  

I designed my own salad (7 ingredients + turkey), and Marcus went with a turkey sandwich.  The salad was huge!  The house balsamic dressing was recommended but I wasn't a fan.  I was happy I requested it on the side because I took it right back up and exchanged it for ranch instead - much better!  Not sure why, but the salad was just ok.  I would request avocado and garbanzo toppings next visit... and a protein other than the turkey.  Marcus seemed to enjoy his sandwich.

LA Fitness is exactly A-OK. For the price of the membership, I feel that I get exactly what I pay for: a solid, in and out, calorie burning experience with maybe a class or two thrown in here and there. 

I've been going to LA Fitness for about four years now. I only ever visit this one. I had a brief stint with the one on McDowell, but this Wildcat felt more at ease away from the ASU gym hangout. Like I mentioned, the membership is decently priced, even with a budget. The equipment is A-OK. It's not top of the line, but it's rarely broken. I will run on the treadmill for 20 more minutes if they ever get ones with TVs built in! 

I really only go to LA Fitness for cardio, but the free weights overtake much of the gym and they have a large selection of bikes, treadmills and ellipticals. Even during the busy time aka gymaholic's happy hour, I always seem to find a treadmill relatively quickly. 

The classes at LA Fitness deserves another star to the review. They have spot on classes! I rotate between spinning, kick boxing, pilates and most recently Zumba. I love them all! The teachers are energetic and kick my butt, the music is fast paced and motivating, and the class agenda stays current. 

The bathroom and locker room is very nice with enough space for a small army of weight-loss hungry gym goers. I pass by the sauna and the pool and while I've never tried either, they look appealing. I always tell myself I should swim more, but haven't made it to this pool yet. The last two highlights for this gym would be the day care classes they offer and the brand new juice bar. I have no idea if the day care is yay or nay, but it was worth mentioning. And be warned, bottles of H20 are a whopping $2,00. Yikes! 

So I suggest LA Fitness if you're like me and use the gym to focus on working out and look for a workout of getting in, getting your sweat on and getting out in a reasonable amount of time.",review,wum4pbf9mlYt1g8gJzfG2A

The downside - you feel like you're walking through a hospital hallway. Fluorescent tube lighting, much?

I went to Fair Trade last night after their stalled initial opening attempt a few weeks ago where their outside cart's espresso machine had broken down and I could only get iced tea. No worries on that, though. It happens. 

Service was nice, coffee was decent (although not remarkable), and similar pastries as the original location. However, I don't think I'd want to linger inside. Seemed way too antiseptic for a coffeehouse, especially one touting fair trade beans and organic foodstuff. One long wooden table for group study - otherwise a couple steel patio tables adorn alongside the windowed walls. Kind of disappointed, but hopefully it's just a work in progress and they'll be adding more in there. 

I like the outdoor patio, though. Nice lit up waterwalls falling into decorative blue rocks, and if you're facing west, you can look up at that giant patient jellyfish (or whatever you want to call it) fluttering in the wind. Nice place to hang, although heading upstairs into Civic Space Park itself is probably nicer.

While the tuna sandwich was very tasty, with its rustic fresh bread and fresh arugula/micro greens and slightly tangy and sweet herbed tuna, I found that my piece of focaccia stole the show. 
This was the focaccia special, topped with cheese (sorry can't recall the specific type),  thin slices of lemon, rosemary, thin sliced red onion, garlic and olive oil, baked to perfection.  Oh my goodness!! The flavors made the half tuna sandwich pale by compairison.

I've been hearing rave reviews about Stax for ages. Hard to believe it took until today to get there, but with a case of the Mondays a coworker and I headed there for lunch hoping some fresh air and good food would rejuvenate us. 

The air was indeed fresh, and the food was delicious. I really loved the laid back atmosphere that we had during lunchtime. And there's definitely something fun about the entrance from the parking lot. 

The menu looked delicious and the idea of items small enough that I can try more than one always makes the indecisive crazy in my happy and quiet. We started with the tots as a starter and chipotle aioli. Presentation is pretty top notch at Stax. I loved that little fryer basket. Reminded me of the little shopping cart at Delux. Love :)

For lunch I went ahead with the exotic burger of the day which was rabbit with mushrooms and tomato and the shrimp po'boy with better battered shrimp, onion, tomato and a delicious sauce... both with no tomato for me. They came exactly as I ordered and were wonderful. I honestly can't tell you which one I liked more; they were both fantastic in their own special unique way. 

Why the 3 stars then? The service left tons to be desired. Everytime we asked a question or wanted to order something, it was like we were being a pain and chore to our server. She always rushed her answers, never looked at us, never smiled, and always mumbled. I wish I could say I ordered an arnold palmer, but it definitely had no tea and the lemonade was so watered down it was as if I simply replaced my cucumber water with lemon water. 

At the end when we had finished our burgers, we still were enjoying our tots. Our server came over to ask if we needed anything else as she cleared our main plates to which we said no.

Then.. the unthinkable happened.

She took the rest of our tots without asking if we were finished.

That's pretty pathetic. I got the buffalo scramble, which has ground buffalo, onion, bell pepper, tomato, mushroom and jack cheese and comes with toast and hashbrowns. I asked for it with no mushrooms.... no such luck, I got mushrooms. That wasn't a huge deal though. The real problem was the overwhelming lack of any flavor. You would think with that list of ingredients that it would have tons of flavor, but it just tasted like mushy, creamy, nothing. There was way too much cheese and the cheese was bland and nasty.... the buffalo being ground is also not a good idea because it has a weird mouth feel and looks like little turds.... also, buffalo is a beautiful meat, why grind it up? I think the lack of flavor may be because they do not saute the veggies before adding the egg (or at least that's my guess.... not sure) Anyway, I thought maybe the hash browns would be better.... no. Tasted like nothing! WTF? Has this place not heard of seasoning? Finally, the toast was standard, but they only had welch's grape jelly on the table.... for 10$ a plate I should get some nice jam... or at least a choice. So overall, mine was a train wreck.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The following night, I was hanging out with my married friend Steve.  We met up with a couple friends of mine at this British pub in Phoenix.  The night was going well and since we were on that side of town, I suggested going to Burn since I had heard it was the hot shit place to be.  I texted a few people to try and make it a group thing - the replies I got were ""Burn? That place is GAY!"" - I naturally assumed they meant that it sucked, but since I hadn't been there I figured I might as well check it out in spite of the snobby review.
 
One of the people in my party even agreed with my text saying - 'yeah, I heard that place was pretty gay.'  Again, I wasn't interested in hearing the nay-sayers say 'nay'.  I'm not going to form opinions on something like this without first hand experience... I'll decide how gay (lame) it is on my own, thanks.  In spite of this, I got us all to agree to mosey over to Burn to check it out since none of us had been there.
 
The couple we were with arrived first and told us they went to the bar next door instead because Burn had a cover.  Steve and I met them for a drink and then decided we wanted to go next door to check out Burn anyway since we had come this far.  At least we were going to see what the cover would be...
 
We walk in the doorway and Steve goes - ""dang, this place is pretty gay..."" to which I inquired if he didn't just want to leave.  Before I could finish my question, he said - ""eh, let's just check it out anyway.""  As he says this I cast my gaze inside the club for the first time to see go-go dancers on platforms... and I'm talking about buff shirtless and hairless dudes in tighty whiteys, cowboy boots and cowboy hats.  Apparently, when my friends were saying ""that place is gay"" - they meant homosexual... Saturday night is gay night.  I am dumb.
 
Before I could say ""let's just get the fuck out of here,"" Steve had paid for both our covers and was making a bee-line for the bathroom (what the fuck is it with making a bee-line for a bathroom in a gay bar?  That's the last place I'd want to be)... I followed him with a hasteful step and stopped outside the bathroom door and planted my back firmly against a wall - again trying to avoid surprise attack anal rapes on my virgin bottom.
 
I take this moment to myself to scan the room and the people in it - mostly dudes... it looked like my gym - everyone was buff and chiseled and model-like.  People seemed to indiscriminantly smack each other on the butts or grab each other in the crotch as they walked by.  After about a minute of this, I text Steve saying ""Fuck this.""  He calls back to tell me he's out on the front patio.  I don't know how he fucking snuck past me, but I met up with him outside. 
 
We both agreed that the gay people at this joint were way more intense than any collective of gay people we had seen before.  Even the lesbians were intense.  Everyone looked both attractive and tough as fuck.  We both kinda felt a sense of danger - we thought we were at risk of getting beat up for being straight. Perhaps this is how isolated gay guys feel in a straight world.  Steve went off to get us drinks and I caught eyes with some straight girls who motioned me over to their table.  After a talk and a drink, Steve and I split.
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We discussed the fact that while we weren't the best looking guys in that place by any stretch - we would probably do well in there if we wanted to hook up with a guy.  Somehow we manage to always include this concept in our conversations - how many people we could get to 'do us' if we wanted.
 
There were crossdressers at this place too.  I was under the assumption that crossdressing doesn't amount to gay necessarily... I mean, if you're gay - why would you want someone that looked like the opposite sex?  I suppose I don't quite understand the concepts or the mechanics fully.  Perhaps it's just because there's no good tranny bars in the valley.
 
After leaving Burn, we were headed to another bar and walking down the street when from a block behind us we heard faint cat calls.  We muttered to each other not to turn around and to ignore it.  Again we heard them and this time we were sure they were directed at us.  ""Hay boyz... wanna taste my meat"" or something of that nature.  Finally we got brave and turned around to discover it was my friend Ryan whom we thought had left already.  I think we both were fearing some sort of brutal reverse gay bashing....

I'd wanted to try a glass of rose ($7), since Mom is a fan, but she was ""too tired"" to have wine, so I'll have to bookmark that for next visit. We started w/ the butternut squash ravioli w/ sage butter ($8; mmm... I adore brown butter and sage... My Mom, however, doesn't). I appreciated the sweet creaminess of the squash puree against the slight toothiness of the ravioli. The sage butter added just enough salt to the dish, while the toasted candied pecan bits on top added impeccable crunch! How I wished I had all three pieces! (She ate one and didn't even enjoy it! How infuriating! LOL)The second dish we tried was the baked escargots w/ butter, parsley, lemon, and puff pastry ($7). Compared to the multi-faceted ravioli dish, this was a bit disappointing. While I enjoyed the textures that the snails and crunchy puff pastry offered (TOO crunchy, if you ask me! Those babies were bordering on hard!

Since I know my adoring fans are anxiously waiting to hear my thoughts on this place, I am happy to oblige.

Zipp's is not a bad option for a work lunch since they have a pretty large menu and can accommodate big parties. The food is mostly bar food with burgers, pizza, fried apps, and wings as their specialties, none of which are my top choice for lunch. But they do have the option of what they refer to as focaccias; they are sort of a cross between a wrap and a panini.  Those are pretty tasty but unfortunately they all come with mayo or some other kind of creamy sauce (yuck!) and so I have to order it without and hope the kitchen gets it right. My go-to item is actually the honey balsamic salad. It is really filling because of all the stuff that's in it and the dressing is really good and goes well with the goat cheese. Overall its not the best food in the area (hey, its Scottsdale after all) but its a safe bet since there is something for everyone and the prices are reasonable.

Zipps is also a great place for happy hour. They have a large patio that is just fantastic because of the wood and comfy seating. You kind of get the feeling you are hanging out on a friend's deck. It can get a little crowded at times, especially on Fridays. And I wish there were more shade. But when the weather is nice you can't beat sitting out in the sunshine with a cold beer watching the game (yes they have tvs outside). Even when the heat drives you inside to the a/c, this place is still worth a visit because of the $3 pints. That's a pretty good deal. They also have $4 for the large 32 oz but that doesn't include the ""premium"" beers.

I remembered seeing Camelback Tanning over at 38th Street and Indian School by Thai Lahna, so I popped in there.  Sandy was working the front desk and was sweet as can be... not the typical person I imagined would work at a tanning salon - she was more a motherly type and made me feel comfortable right away.  She took the time to assess what bed would be best for my visit, whipped me up a special bronzer, and walked me into the room to show me exactly what to do.

Fifteen minutes was all it took... and for $7, I think it did the trick!  I can't say that I'll be back soon but it's good to know that if I need a little (un)natural color, Camelback Tanning delivers!",review,2FiLqh18ypsamf2vZOj7eA

Wanted to get a much-needed mani/pedi before my sister and my dinner with a friend Saturday night, so I brought baby sis, my niece, and me to Scottsdale Nails II, but we were told the staff was fully booked until later on that afternoon, around 430p (it was around 1030a).  I told the man at the desk that we had other plans for the day and needed two mani/pedis right away before lunch, so he suggested we try out McDowell Mountain Nails on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd.  I've never been, but I knew the location, so I told my sister ""why don't we try it?""

Situated at the Target plaza, between a Jamba Juice and a Ross on FLW east of the 101, MMN was easy to find.  It looked very unassuming from the outside, certainly much smaller than Scottsdale Nails II and my ex-favorite Shea Nails on 92nd St. (please read my reviews).  It was small indoors, but clean, and most importantly, lacked the horribly strong stench of chemicals that greeted us at Scottsdale Nails a few minutes before.  We were greeted by a young Caucasian male who was standing next to a female Asian, who was speaking on the phone.  A little different, since we're used to frequenting salons entirely staffed by Asians...  I asked if the two of us would be able to have our mani/pedis worked on right away, as well as my niece and her manicure, and he assured us most definitely.  The woman had by then gotten off the phone (thank goodness, as she was speaking directly to our faces while on the phone, instead of moving off to the side to give herself and us more privacy).  He told her what we were looking for, and she proceeded to tell him who to pair us up with.  I heard that I was going to get ""the new girl,"" which then made me think, ""why me?""  ""Why do I get to try the new girl?""  I wasn't worried, however, as I had a feeling everything would work out fine.  After choosing our polish materials, we all went our separate ways.

The ""new girl"" Ann, was a joy to be with!  While she is new to this company, she told me she's been a nail tech for many years.  She had just finished a couple hours of orientation (she learned what the packages/treatments were called, and what steps she had to fulfill, etc.) that morning, and I was her first customer!  She worked gently, and listened to me tell her how we came to try out this salon, and would ask a couple of times if she was causing any discomfort.  Very easy to converse with- in case some of you are not able to understand staff with heavy accents, Ann speaks fluent English (and is studying Biochemistry... we're common souls!), so if this is important to you, ask for Ann.  :)

We finished slightly after my sister and her daughter.  My sister was seated for her spa pedicure before her manicure, while Ann started on my manicure first.  My niece was originally going to get just a manicure, but when I saw the embellishments that Linda had added to the nails, I asked how much it would be for a pedicure polish.  I was told $5 for just color, and $10 for the matching white polka dots and silver points.  I said let's get it done!

$55 for my gel manicure and spa pedicure, $25 for my niece's manicure (cleaning and polish) and pedicure (polish only), plus slightly over 20% tip*.  My sister got acrylic nails on her hands and a spa pedicure, as well.  We all left very happy and very satisfied with our new looks!  (Niece absolutely ENJOYED her first visit to the nail salon and cannot wait till their return here next year for another one!)  Thank you, McDowell Mountain Nails... I'll be a returning customer!

The ice cream is creamy, it's light, it's fluffy, it's addicting and it's really just everything you think about in an ice cream. The other reviews explain the ice cream to the core, so I won't go too into detail about the flavors, but I will say that my two favorites for now are the chocolate brownie and of course, the salted Carmel. Put them together and it's definitely 'ice cream-you-scream-we-all-scream-for-Sweet Republic-ice cream-sweetness.'

Here's another special treat to Sweet Republic. Their heavenly toffee! It could be the best toffee I've ever had. In fact, I think I'm going to deem it the best toffee I've had to-date. The almond toffee is buttery, crunchy and soft all together. I put it on top of my salted Carmel ice cream, forgot about every calorie I was consuming and enjoyed sweet moments of Sweet Republic bliss. The bacon brittle intrigued me and I must say, I wasn't too eager to try it. But, after reading about it so often, I had to give it a whirl and was happily surprised! The bacon taste definitely overtakes the taste of the toffee making it taste like you are eating bacon with an infused taste of left-over syrup from your pancakes. Actually, I bet it would taste pretty good on top of waffles or pancakes! 

So with that, I will end the 241st review of Sweet Republic.

I cruise in here and I the decor was nice.   Clean, attractive, inviting.  Nice!  I reviewed the menu, and thought that it would just be easier to order simple.  I stuck with a small pepperoni pizza.

I was under the impression that this was going to be a thicker style pizza.   I was sadly wrong.  It was thin and honestly, didn't taste all that great.  It was kind of greasy to me, also.   I really wanted this pizza to be good.  I mean, it was okay, but it was less then what I had anticipated.

They also had gelato there, which I've never seen at a pizza joint before. Interesting.   I did order the mint gelato, which was tasty!  The gelato bumped it up a star.   If my review was based on pizza only, it would have been two stars. Decor, friendly staff and tasty gelato bumped it up a star.

I went in for dinner at about 6:30 and there wasn't a lot going on so I went in and ordered a red, green, and carne asada taco with a ""lemonade."" The girl behind the counter was boasting about their fresh squeezed ""lemonade"" and I like when it isn't canned mix so I ordered it. I went outside and got a seat on the counter looking into the building and after about 10 minutes they brought out my food. I was actually kind of amazed it took that long to make 3 tacos, but whatever, that was fine. 

The first taco, the red, was ok. Perhaps it was the fact that it was overloaded with beans, cabbage, and other mixtures of everything that usually is on your plate at a mexican restaurant, but I thought it didn't really have a flavor. The green was much of the same, no real flavor, but not a bad experience. They were both just ""meh."" Maybe now would be a good time to comment on that ""lemonade."" IT TASTED LIKE A FUCKING SLURPEE FROM 7-11. You have got to be kidding me if you are going to tell me this is a fresh squeezed lemonade. For ***** sake you even told put slurpee ice in it. I'm not buying it whatsoever, that this has ANY real lemon content. Ok, so now that final taco, the carne asada. I had high hopes since the other two were so bland I thought maybe it'd be harder to mess up carne asada, but I was wrong. It had absolutely no flavor, and had a horrid texture I don't know if the meat was overcooked or what but it tasted like a taco with beans and cardboard. I had to douse it in lime and hot sauce to make it edible, and still bearly was so, partly because the hot sauce they provide is not so tasty either. 

I didn't look for a restroom, but I imagine they have one, as they would never be allowed to build the restaurant without at least one public restroom.

As I've previously stated, I was never going to rush back to kabuki. The first and only trip was enough for me. However, about two months or so ago, I was invited to a lunch for a project I was on, and I hesitantly went. The lunch was back to back with a meeting I had... knowing this, and my issues last time, I arrived a half hour early with another coworker to make sure my order was in. We each ordered three rolls if I remember correctly. After we ordered, the others arrived (please note, it took a half hour to be able to put our order in... even though no one was in the restaurant).

Everyone else began to put theirs in as well and sushi and other ordered items began to arrive. 20 more minutes passed and I soon realized everyone had their food but me. Even those that ordered after. It was now close to my time to leave so I flagged down our server and asked him if I could have my sushi to go. I wasn't extremely hungry, but knew I would be craving something by mid afternoon.

It all went downhill from here. Rather than checking on my order or anything else for that matter, I was attacked and accused of not putting an order down. After all, had it been, it obviously would've been at the table. After 5 minutes of several people ensuring him my order was on a list, I gave up and said to just bring me a philly roll quick so I can not starve myself. One of my coworkers graciously gave up his take home items so I could eat. I was ever thankful.

I left angry and upset...but thanks to friends not completely starving. The food was good, but quickly overlooked by the terrible service I've received both times I've been here. Honestly the food is the only thing that gives them the 2nd star. I bitched on twitter about my disdain and soon had a message from their corporate office. They wanted to call me to discuss the matter with that locale. I told them I didn't really wish to speak with the locale. What's done is done. I wasn't sure what they could honestly say to make me feel better about how I was treated.

Kabuki responded with a rather generous gift card. I decided I would give them one more shot (after all, it was on the house). Honestly I was scared to use it... even with the meal being free, I wasn't sure I could handle the stress of another bad experience. It took me nearly a month to use it.

This past week, I returned and took with me the kind coworker who offered me their take home sushi. We made sure to go on a day where we didn't have any appointments immediately after lunch. We also arrived early. Once again, the place was practically empty. There were only 4 other people there. 

We started off with drinks as we pondered the menu. The drinks my friends, are heavenly. I had a lychee mojito and an apple saketini and practically downed them in one gulp. Filled to the brim, tasteful and beautiful works of art they were. 

We both ordered a few different items. I got two rolls and some nigiri. I was honestly shocked at the relatively ok speed at which they came out. We received our sushi about a half hour after ordering it. Still not super fast, but well, it's better than not getting it at all. The presentation was decent and the sushi was delicious. My ebi nigiri came with a tempura shrimp in the shape of a bunny. That creeped me out a lot. Please don't do that.

In the end, the service is still slow enough and I've had so many bad experiences there, that I would not trust it for lunch. It will never be in my top 5 places to go at any point in time. However, if I end up arriving at Tempe Marketplace 3 hours early for an event, or if someone wants to go to grab a saketini, I will consider it. The only saving grace this establishment has is it's corporate office, a saketini, and decent sushi (once you get it).

We stopped by Flo's looking for items to decorate with, and unfortunately we only found green tea lights.  This place is great though.

It's refreshing to walk into a second hand store and not be bombarded with the usual toxic scent of moth balls and death.  This was no Goodwill.  Instead, we were greeted by a couple cashiers the second we walked in the door.  The store was very well organized, and I didn't have to fight my way through aisles of dirty clothes to find things.  You can find high quality home decor on the right and left of the store.  Nice clothing is organized neatly on multiple small clothing racks.  I didn't have a lot of time to rifle through the clothes, but I did see a good number of cute things I wouldn't mind adding to my wardrobe.

The main drawback is that I saw a couch in here that I instantly wanted to buy.  It was a beautiful rust color with gorgeous curves and a modern flair.  Unfortunately, this was part of the store's furniture.  Read: Not for sale.  Boo.  Maybe next time I will just ask where they bought it.

Checked out the new expansion last night and I have to say I'm quite impressed. They took over some greasy food joint next door and instead of knocking out a wall and openin' 'er up, they simply added two entrances from the existing Yucca bar you know and love (ahem, some of us know and love quite a bit more than others).

So the first entrance is right off the OG entrance, and the second entrance is punched out of the wood paneling wall where the booths stop on that side. Kinda funny since you won't notice it until someone comes through it, and the glowing white light and shiny floor pulls you in like siren song. 

However, the cuteness of the hidden door quickly wears off if you happen to be there on a packed night, because it's placement causes a TON of traffic jams and pushing and shoving as people try to go back/forth from expansion to OG bar, and try to make their way from back/front of OG bar, and people trying to watch the band get sick of shuffling around the disaster. They need a light or a stop sign or something, it was just a mess!

But what about the fucking expansion already, right? No complaints there, not a one. I followed that soft glowing light, past three pool tables, two sparkly new (single person) bathrooms and to the bar, I was lead to a refrigerated cooler of ""craft"" beers. Beers in there range from $4 - $9. On tap, they had about 8 beers that included SKA True Blonde, Framboise, etc. I got the SKA and it was $4.25

The service was fast and friendly and I was pretty happy to belly up there and wait for my friends. That's when someone sat down next to me and ordered ""two slices of pizza, with pineapple and olives."" Um, what? You can order FOOD here? You sure can, my dear bar flys. They have a full kitchen that churns out slices, calzones and sandwiches. Whoa! If you were trying to give Taste of Tops a run, you certainly beat them in the food department. 

OK, I'm gonna wrap this up since I have a problem with brevity:

Awesome: Custom wall paper with Yucca's signature guitar logo, records and such; local artist paintings for sale and just for looking at; god, those nice new bathrooms need another mention!

Oh! One last thing. A little birdie told me that the craft bar does not factor into the pay out to the bands that play in the OG bar. Something to consider when you come *specifically to see a cool band for no cover.* They make money off a percent of the bar bill (in this case, the OG bar bill only), so keep that in mind.",review,q9_N4b26UhGAYicjueUinQ

I have to say I was almost a little disappointed upon arriving to find that it is a fairly nice restaurant, not the hole-in-wall, don't look under the table, in the window sills, and especially the kitchen, kind of place that we all know have the BEST food.  And with a nicer store front usually comes a higher price tag.  Mi Patio is no different.  Combination plates are in the $10 range.  Kind of expensive for Mexican food in my opinion.  Perhaps I'm still living in 1978.

In spite of that, we were seated and introduced to their chips and salsa.  The chips, unfortunately, were cold.  Had they been hot, they would have been the thin and crispy tortilla chips I love.  But the salsa was really really really good.

Because my husband and I have vowed to eat less in 2010, we shared a meal, an appetizer in fact.  Unfortunately, it was the $17 appetizer supreme that would have fed half of Mexico.  A pizza-sized platter filled with mini chimis, flautas, red chile nachos, and gyro slices (I thought that was odd, but my husband loved them).

What a turnaround I experienced this time.

We were seated immediately but we waited a good 5-10 minutes before someone came over to us.  Our server, J, came over and sincerely apologized.  He took our drink order and immediately came back with our sodas.  We had decided what to eat and I ordered the Sirloin in Cancun style (spice rubbed with a creamy wine sauce with peppers, corn, and shrimp) and the husband ordered a burger.  J recommended a particular burger that was only on the lunch menu, stating it was way better, and hooked the husband up with that one instead.

My steak was very good, although slightly undercooked in the very middle only.  It only makes sense because it was so thick and everywhere else was perfect.  The asparagus that came with it was very well grilled and seasoned and was a perfect accompaniment to the slab of meat.  During our meal, J kept our sodas constantly full.  When we finished he offered us dessert and we politely declined.  We usually never order desserts at restaurants because too often they aren't prepared in house.  This was not good enough for J, and he wasn't taking no for an answer.  After a little prodding, a wink, and an ""I'm feeling extra nice today"" he hooked us up with a free cheesecake, which we were delighted to learn was made in house.  We devoured that, it was very good.  He came back and asked us about it and the husband mentioned the crust being a little dry.  I told him some more butter will solve that and he said he would pass it on to the kitchen.

Experience means a lot to me when it comes to rating a restaurant.  If I have a great server, it will improve my feelings for a restaurant.  J was absolutely amazing.  He was friendly, attentive, and really nice to chat with.  What a wonderful evening we had dining by candlelight on the patio.

The guitar player/singer was actually really good but they had a full amp and speaker system even though it is a pretty small place and so this made it very difficult to carry on a conversation with the other couple we were with.

I didn't feel comfortable enough to eat a full dinner since the height made it difficult to use utensils so I just got appetizers.  The red pepper hummus was good but the plain one was not too good.  I also tried the potstickers - fun to try something different (they were made with crocodile meat) but nothing to write home about.  My husband got the Roo burger which he said had a good taste but a weird texture.  I also tried one of the bruschetta pieces that someone else in our party had ordered.  I love brie but this one was nothing really special.  They had a variety of bruschetta options but they were pretty much the same options that have become trendy with all the wine bars in the valley that I have been to.  I think the best part of the meal was actually the sweet potato fries that came with my husband's burger.  These were really, really good.

Two of us also got the evening's tasting flight.  All the wines we sampled were very good.  However, you only got four two oz pours for $20.  I noticed the prices were very good during Happy Hour so I would consider going back for that but I don't think I could take those horrible chairs after working a full day at work.  I won't be back unless they get new furniture.",review,9dopZKjYiKwPiw7kEQsEag

Very, very good late lunch/early dinner meal for me, and it all started with a classic mojito.  Not the Garden mojito on the specialty cocktails menu that has cucumber in it (allergy).  Just a mojito made from a well rum, in this case Bacardi.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=9-cZ-SOtiX2ihwdrCs2FrQ  $6 during happy hour.  And it's a good one!  Fresh, muddled mint, a bit of lime juice, a spritz of ginger ale, sugar, and rum.  Initially I thought it a bit too sweet (from the ginger ale, instead of carbonated soda) but perhaps the alcohol content had something to do with my change of mind... :)

I was considering a bruschetta plate with two cheeses, but decided against it when I had a look at the dessert menu.  Nope, I'm just going to have a small plate of Pesto chitarra ($10) and perhaps the cherry zeppole later.  I have to tell you, I've been dreaming about this pasta dish for years, since the first time I saw another Yelper post a picture of it somewhere.  Years!!  And today's dish did not disappoint.  No, not at all.  You'd think after a few years' buildup on how spectacular this plate looks, I might not enjoy it so much, but I was happy with it.  Yep, I'm just going to come out and say it-- I ate the whole thing!  Every ""guitar"" string, all the grape tomato halves (which, honestly, wasn't hard to do, since there were only two whole pieces to speak of), each and every grated parmesan-coated pine nut, and all of the pesto sauce. I may have left some charred bits of the toasted focaccia bread on the plate, but what wasn't charred I used to sop up all of that pesto-infused EVOO.  The entire entree was off the hook!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=wYz23WxyjrTKUXsSUwnKSw  

Now, this is where any practical and health-conscious person would say, ""Ok, I've had enough.  I can't eat another bite.""  But, I can't be practical.  Not when I'm half-way through my mojito!  So, I went ahead and ordered the zeppole ($6.50), and it took more than a few minutes to arrive, but I wasn't in a hurry.  When the six little Italian puffs of sugar-coated fresh-fried dough arrived, accompanied by two small pots of almond crema and Maker's Mark bourbon mascarpone, I knew I was in for a treat!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=0-sLOjmoMEBkWAcTZyHskQ  Even before I took a bite, I could detect the scent of cherries that were inside the fried moulds of dough, some of which you could see peeking through the sparkling sugar crystals.  And yes, I ate all six of them, and all of the almond crema.  There was no doubt that the mascarpone contained bourbon- it's pretty strong, and I didn't mind it, not at all, especially when you combine it with the almond, but had I known just how much i'd enjoy the almond crema, I'd have them give me two pots of it, instead of the mascarpone.  Now I know.

I wasn't stoked, however, to learn that NTN and team trivia were two different things.  And I wasn't stoked to wait 10 minutes for our server to wipe down our sticky table.

Regardless, this place's parking lot was packed and the bar was buzzing with Thursday night football and baseball fans drinking down pitchers and pints.  Aside from the pool table and shuffleboard, as if that alone wasn't awesome enough - they have FOOZBALL too!!

The food and service was pretty average. I ordered a grilled chicken and ortega chile  sandwich with Monterey jack cheese.  It tasted pretty bland - I ate only half, which if you know me, means it must have been pretty blah.  The fries were the zesty seasoned variety - probably frozen, but were still pretty good.  Rum and cokes here were standard as well.  Glasses were shorter than expected, but neither too weak, nor too strong. 

Now to the trivia.  It's team driven and can go kind of slow.  So the bigger the group at the table, the more brainpower (but also, the more likely for differing answers and arguments).  For my friend and I, who thought we were at a disadvantage - we coasted to 3rd place (out of 10).  Not too bad, and we won a gift certificate back to Hazelwoods.  I'll use it someday I'm sure.  Like when I'm in the neighborhood or something.  Not in a big rush.

Ok, I'm downgrading to a one-star review, which is for the understaffed Saturday when I went to watch Big-Ten football and have some lunch with a gift certificate.  One server to about 30 people in the entire restaurant portion.  To add insult to injury, I paid with a $10 GC and left a $2 tip for an $8 lunch and the server chased me out when I left and couldn't wait any longer.

It's charming, intimate, locally-owned and most importantly, the food is phenomenal! I stopped by one recent Sunday after church and ate myself into a happy food coma. We decided to share the cinnamon stuffed french toast and silver dollar blueberry baked pancakes because we were told both were a must-try menu items! For some reason I thought silver dollar pancakes meant they were small, but I soon learned that nothing at Wy-Knot Cafe is small! 

I don't even know how to begin to describe the cinnamon stuffed french toast. Heaven in your mouth? Yes. Dessert for breakfast? Yes. Worth every single calorie and then some? A million times yes! The combination of the fluffy cinnamon french toast and the cream cheese stuffing is divine. The dish is huge and because each bite is so amazing, it's tempting to find it in your to gorge yourself and finish! I definitely ate more of the cinnamon stuffed french toast than the silver dollar pancakes, but those were also very good! However, the french toast trumped any other dish in my mind. The silver dollar blueberry pancakes were huge! The dish comes with three very large baked pancakes and so the meal was very much of a carbo-load...in a very good way! After all, if you are going to consume the calories, it might as well be worth it and this food was very much worth it. 

We got lucky because when we went, it wasn't very crowded. Therefore our food didn't take too long.

Some weeks ago, while I was at REI, I thought I'd feel good about myself and eat more organic food so I decided to come here. 

I casually walked in, and there was a little sample tray of chips and guacamole. The guac was pretty damn tasty, and I thought I'd get some. There they were, in dinky 8 oz containers. How much do you think they'd cost? $2.99? $3.99? Hell, even $4.99?

Nope. 

$7.49!!!! For 8 oz of guacamole!

Unless there's gold flakes in this tub of mushed avocado, wtf?!

I know Whole Foods is all about organics, but everytime I walk around this place, I ponder how people can shop there regularly. I always leave with $65 worth of stuff, all in just one grocery bag, nothing of which in the contents I even remember later.

Although this I remembered: the $7.99/lb salad bar. 

Ok, I can play at this game. I'm going to put one sliver of everything in my container and still be less than a pound. 

But guess what. 

No scales at the salad bar. Unless you're a whiz with weights, you're screwed royally until you check out. This pissed me off to no end. Now I know that for most people who shop here, spending an extra $5 on salad for one evening is nothing, but I still find this ploy particularly annoying. My container of spinach leaves, tomato slices, cucumber, some lentil couscous thing, and a tiny spoon of some curried tofu? $11.87.

Friends, I paid $12. For grocery store salad.

Whole Foods would definitely rank higher in my mind if it wasn't for the fact that all the organic stuff I usually buy I can get from Sprouts for $2 cheaper, at least. 

But hey, WF at least helped put organic food on the map and the quality of many goods is top notch, overpriced avocado slime or no.

After going inside the place was really cute and well decorated.  Plenty of seating with lots of stuff to shop for!  I did find the ordering to be a bit confusing, and somewhat irritating.  You go to the register and place your order, and their supposed to call your name, but we sat there for a while and never heard anything.  I finally went to the counter and I guess our food had sat out there for a while and no one ever told us! No one called our name, nothing!  Plus, they just left the food on this table to get picked up, and anyone could have taken it without us realizing it.

Also, we were extremely thirsty and were looking for water and asked when we went to place our order.  They said that there's water glasses by a complimentary water station in the dining area.  The glasses were tiny, and there wasn't any ice!  ggggrrrr. It's hot here and we're THIRSTY.  Plus, that area is really tight, so we had to make like 3 trips to get water since we were dying.

Ok, now for the compliments.  The food was awesome! My mom and I really both loved our experience here, and the english muffins were delicious! My mom even bought a pack to take home with her, as she really enjoyed the food as much as i did.  I went with the eggs rancheros, and it was so tasty! I had never had it before and boy, did I clean my plate on this dish!  Fresh fruit came with it to, and the english muffin was tasty with what appeared to be home made jelly.

I'd visited a few years ago, but it was too busy, and I didn't have time to wait 30 to 45 minutes to be seated, so I left.  I've had CK bookmarked to try since.  When I heard word that CK was offering a Fourth of July special (buy one entree, get the second for $4), I thought it was time to see what all the fuzz was about.

Two weeks beforehand, I made plans with a cousin to have lunch here on the 4th.  What a surprise to find out that CK was serving brunch, as well, and we breakfast lovers were thrilled to check out the breakfast items.  While our server went to check on a few ingredients for me, my cousin decided she'd try one of CK's more popular menu items, the Green chile burger, with poblano chile, cheddar, and chipotle aioli. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=MrEVQGZ6ZpX_8iuN0UWPxg#MrEVQGZ6ZpX_8iuN0UWPxg  As you may notice, the kitchen had forgotten to add the chipotle aioli, but this was quickly remedied when we asked for some.  (Service during lunch was very friendly and quick.)  I couldn't decide between the French omelet (which, funnily enough, my cousin and I initially mistook to be French toast and wanted to order this immediately) and the Lemon-ricotta hotcakes, but when I was told I could order one pancake for around $2, I chose the Classic French omelet, with sauteed spinach, gruyere, and herbs http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=TVcjVg-hfSZCtnFq3FnaZA#TVcjVg-hfSZCtnFq3FnaZA and a hotcake.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=dtpAV4WfApPEZx_PvczrxA#dtpAV4WfApPEZx_PvczrxA  The omelet struck me as overcooked, and it was.  I asked my cousin to try it, and she too didn't like it, so I let our server know, and she quickly offered to take it away and replace it with something else.  I chose a plate of hotcakes, since we pretty much inhaled the first one!  I apologize for the lack of a photo...  My hunger got the best of me.  BTW, cousin loved her burger-- she finished all of the meat!  I never knew she could eat as much as me.  :)

The decor was beautiful-- lovely dark wooden tables and chairs, cozy booths lined with dark wooden beams, and heavy red fabric curtains, lightened with light-colored flowers, adorned the windows.  It felt classy bistro married country French and had a baby.  It worked for me.  

A few days leading up to the Fourth, I thought a friend would enjoy trying out the dinner menu with me, so we agreed to meet there slightly before 6p.  It was very busy, much louder, and darker indoors that night.  The wait proved to be around 30 mins, or so, and we were given a buzzer as we elected to wait at the bar.  He ordered a cucumber-laced cocktail, while I asked for a blackberry-prickly pear concoction.  Both glasses were served to us without coasters or napkins, so our glasses left puddles on the table from which water would eventually end up dripping from our glasses to other points of the table, or, in my case, on me.  Even when we were finally seated at the table, our cocktail glasses remained un-coastered (is that even a word?), but now we had water glasses, too.  What a mess...

Before we were seated, I had to use the restroom, and I'd already noted earlier, as we walked towards the bar, that it's much harder to traverse the restaurant's space on my four-inch heels.  Not so much because of the heels, but because the textured floor was very slippery, and it wasn't even wet then.  On my return from the restroom, I had to pass the hallway between the kitchen and the bar, and I slipped on a water spill.  Thankfully, I was able to recover without having to hit the ground, but when I hailed a passing employee to alert her of the spill, how I almost had an accident, and that maybe she could see that it was taken care of, she just looked at the spill, then at me, and then proceeded to head to wherever she was going before I stopped her.  She didn't acknowledge that there was a problem, so I assumed she didn't care and wasn't going to do anything about it.  

The food was OK-- he wanted to try the salmon ($22), but was going to order the filet mignon ($37) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=W6wIGzyT32_AvSvqe7uuHA#W6wIGzyT32_AvSvqe7uuHA, and I secretly wanted to try the filet, so I ordered the fish, so that we could try both!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=oDlf6yqCLHn7uw3SuZfflg#oDlf6yqCLHn7uw3SuZfflg  The filet was TERRIFIC.  Perfectly cooked- he asked for pink throughout, but there were a few red spots.  Still tasted amazing.  The kitchen ran out of mixed veggies so friend ended up with bok choy, which he's never had before, but soon learned to like it.  The salmon would've been very good, if it didn't have a slight rancid-fish taste to it.  The lemon-white wine reduction helped.  Still, our plates were clean at the end of our meal.

A group of girlfriends and I met here for happy hour and really enjoyed ourselves!  I arrived first and so was able to secure a parking spot right at the entrance of the venue.  The shopping area of this establishment was an eclectic mix of ""vintage"" and contemporary items ranging from leather jackets that sell by the pound and tree-hugger organic tees to hand-painted glasses and nostalgic candies in old-fashioned wrappers.  There's even a boxing rink for those who suddenly feel the itch to go a few rounds!  (Back to those vintage jackets- I took this to mean that every jacket was weighed and charged a fixed price per pound, but this wasn't so... Each jacket I tried on had a different dollar amount per pound assigned.  A gimmick that initially piqued my curiosity suddenly made me want to leave the shopping area and just head over to the restaurant and check out the drink and food offerings.)  The indoor dining area was set up for community-style dining, w/ long rectangular tables and high benches.  Outdoors, there were picnic tables and chairs on one side and a silver streamliner at the other where all food orders are placed, w/ people lining up to order, pay, and then retrieve their orders when called.  Another gimmick that I probably wouldn't mind if I were dining outside, but didn't care for since I was dining indoors w/ friends, a couple who'd ordered food and a couple who didn't, away from cigarette smoke and the cold air...

Two of the three girlfriends had arrived before the 6p HH cut-off, but one, Linda, had to take a call, and she was therefore left out of the ""duce off"" each drink deal.  This was the first time I ever had a grasshopper (cremes de menthe and cacao and cream over ice), and I enjoyed it very much!  So much, I bought my own supplies  to make my own version a few days later!  The friend who was not given the discount had originally wanted a light beer (@ 5:50p), but was told none were offered here.  We all liked our selections and agreed that we'd very much like to meet again for HH.

One of us is allergic to gluten (no, not me!) AND a vegetarian, so after she had asked HER set of questions, she ordered the omelet skillet, first w/ ingredients that the kitchen was out of (asparagus?), so she settled w/ mushrooms, spinach, and goat cheese.  She enjoyed the dish, and stated that the veggies were very fresh!  I had the Brisket sliders and an order of house-made potato crisps, which I was told were coated w/ EVOO and baked, not fried (the streamliner kitchen was not equipped w/ a fryer).  I found the chips to be too greasy and overcooked (see photos), but my gluten-free vegetarian friend found them addictive!  I liked the brisket sliders (""the best you've ever tasted,"" said a co-owner) at the restaurant, although I did find some of the meat tough to chew so I put those aside, but found the leftovers fatty and sinewy- a chore to chew- the next day.  Not worth ordering again.  Linda decided to order dessert to share- the baked cinnamon-pecan French toast.  This sweet looked so enticing that I finally broke down and tried it, even though I have a pecan allergy.  I ate the caramelized toast pieces around the nuts (which doesn't prevent an allergic response since the oil is baked throughout the dessert) and found THIS delight addictive!  I hope the kitchen comes up w/ other versions that use other nuts, such as walnuts, almonds, even hazelnuts...

Music and movie reviews that aren't catering to ""the man"". And always a few articles about campus life or some other ""it's cool with young people"" article that cracks me up.

This time, however, was a completely different experience.

The menu has an offering of burgers, chicken, and fish and chips.  There are onion rings, fried mushrooms, and fries for sides.  A few other items round out the simple item and everything is very reasonably priced, most being under 6 dollars.  I chose the bacon cheeseburger with American cheese and a wheat bun.  A pleasant surprise is the fact that you can choose between white, wheat, and onion buns.  Yay!  We also got a side of fries to share.  The total for 2 Works burgers, a side of fries, and 2 sodas was about 16 bucks.  Not bad at all.

I could immediately see that I was getting a good burger when I took off the top bun and visited the condiment bar.  The burger patty itself was large and slightly misshapen, definitely a hand formed patty.  The condiment bar has pretty much all the typical fixings that you would expect.  This was a good burger.  It was well seasoned, nicely cooked, and had a great charred taste.  The bun was fresh tasting and a nice change from the typical sesame seed burger bun.  The fries were portioned for one person, but they were substantial and tasty.

I really enjoyed this place from the cheap prices to the awesome vintage decor.  The tables were brushed copper and very cool looking.  The entire restaurant is actually larger than it looks from the outside and even has a bit of outdoor seating.  There is a decent sized bar on the side of the restaurant that everyone seemed to be having a great time at.  If I am in the mood for a no-nonsense good quality burger, I will definitely come here.",review,N_6bV3c3JagKW7sD3X9ldA

Instead, disappointment on all the fronts. The time I had pho it was just standard and nowhere near as abundant in flavor and aroma as some other Vietnamese places, even with the bowl of basil, scallions, chilis, and bean sprouts dumped inside it. To be fair, they were lighter on the MSG because I didn't leave with any dry mouth. And maybe that's why the flavor was missing. Who knows exactly.

The next time I had a lemongrass chicken dish which on the menu looked really appealing and authentic. However, I didn't recognize it as a Vietnamese dish when it got to my table. It seemed like generic Americanized Chinese food on par with Panda Express, but maybe even less so. The lemongrass was so charred that none of the flavor actually made it to the rest of the dish. I ate half of it and was done. And I'm a guy who usually finishes his food.

I think two chances were enough to formulate an opinion about this place. You could definitely find worse food in the neighborhood, but you could also find better. Had I based this review on just the pho, it would be three stars. But the lemongrass chicken was a turnoff so unfortunately I'm taking it down a notch.

At first glance you ask yourself how many Indian jewelry shops can the area possibly sustain? Well the answer is, the turquoise market in Old Town seems to be doing quite well. So it was on a recent exploration trip that we happened upon David's Hamburger's and Mexican Food. So for me the idea of killer burger and tasty Mexican good is a match made in heaven, were talking major food groups here. 

Tucked between 2 galleries, David's is a blink and you'll miss it kind of place, very unassuming and humble. Inside you won't be wowed by the interior design but what they do have is functional and comfortable. With TV's at both ends of the hall like space, you'll be entertained by performance videos of 50's era rock 'n roll. 

I usually don't write much about soda pop, well never, but in this case the Cherry Coke ($1.95) was kind of special. When you order a Coke you can ask them to add a number of different flavorings from lemon and vanilla to chocolate and of course cherry. David's version is wonderfully fizzy and cuts through the richness of the upcoming meal. 

Of all the ways Mexican style meat is prepared, the grilled taste of beef is my all time favorite. If you enjoy this as much as I do then Id suggest the Carne Asada Nachos ($8.59). A massive pile of crunchy tortilla chips is covered in grilled beef strips, melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. While basic, I ate most of them myself leaving my partner to scraping the cheese off of the plate. If you'd like salsa on your chips, be sure to ask them to bring you bowls of green and red salsa. 

Now who doesn't like a big juicy hamburger? David's doesn't disappoint with David's Single ($5.99), say that 2 times fast. A 1/3lb patty topped with the usual suspects, then dressed with David's creamy sauce which to me was a thick version of Thousand Isle dressing, adding a layer of tangy goodness. Along side you have your choice of fries or you can choose to upgrade ($.99) to a mix of large deep fried onion rings and golden French fries. For dipping I a side of David's sauce did the trick in lieu of ketchup. 

The Patty Melt ($7.25) is classic diner food. We're talking thick ground beef patty, melted cheese and grilled onions on your choice of grilled sourdough or rye bread. The wholesome grease from the beef patty and grilled onions is absorbed into the bread creating a creamy like texture, for me this is what a patty melt is all about. Of course the Guacamole Burger ($6.25) with its pepper jack cheese, bacon and guacamole is the marriage of Mexican and American influence. 

If you're an early riser, David's also serves breakfast like Bacon Pancakes ($6.75) and Coconut Waffles ($6.25). Someone please pass the syrup. My only question, where is the breakfast burrito?",review,4YfXP-NxQXntqi0qAknU5g

We split bruschetta and a pizza, both were outstanding.

I first had the combo of fig and prosciutto at a reception in Berkeley and loved it then.  

We had the porco pizza.  Another interesting combination with pulled pork, serrano chili's and other good stuff.  The thin roasted crust at La Bocca is a hit with me!

The service was good but I did get a sense the server wanted to be somewhere else.  Oh well.  Overall a solid experience and I will be back.

My review probably sounds pretty shocking because the experience WAS shocking. I describe in very accurate detail the specifics of what was dirty and what was handled unprofessionally. I did not exaggerate anything (though I fully admit my use of humor undermines the seriousness of my observations). I'm not complaining that there wasn't bottled water service or TVs, I think that's pretty clear in my review. I'm pointing out that I think (and I'm sure many others would agree) that when you go to an office where people stick their hands and instruments into your mouth, you don't want to look around and see grime on the floors, counters and walls or rust on the sink fixtures. I am not a medical professional, but anyone who has even been to a doctor has seen basic protocol when handling a patient (i.e., watching them open a clean pack of tools, watching them wash their hands in front of you before touching you), and they simply did not follow it here. 
The review is not judgmental; it was fair and honest. I pointed out the good (what little there was of it) and the bad. The doctor and all his techs and receptionist were beyond nice and I said as much. But that's hardly the most important thing here.  
To this day, I regret not walking out after the x-rays were taken. 
I do hope that the office was just in some sort of odd transitional phase and that by the time the other reviewer got there things had changed, I really do. But after what I went through, I'm not willing to give them a second chance. Their lack of professionalism and protocol put me in danger, and that's unacceptable. And not just for me, that's unacceptable for anyone -- the office does pro bono work for the homeless or kids in CPS, that's great, they deserve professional care just as much as I do.",review,N-JfaAr4hRdjE5vV0i1dxw

I wanted to go check this place out since they are participating in ""Hawt On Yelp,"" and since I was making the drive, I rewarded myself with an appointment for a facial and brow wax.  Lucky for me, my appointment was with Suzanna, and she was incredible.  But let me back up a second...  before I met Suzanna, I met Maggie.  Maggie gave me a quick tour of the place and brought me to my locker where I met the most comfy robe I've ever put on my body.  And then I was escorted to the heaven that lay ahead of me in Suzanna's room.

We started with the brow wax and I could tell Suzanna was good as she carefully explained what she was going to do to make sure the brows were even and cleaned up just right to accent my eyes.  Next the facial began and she talked / educated me just enough so that I could relax and enjoy but learn a little something too... several scrubs, a partial pumpkin peel, a mask, exfoliation, and moisturizer later, I was given a choice: hands, feet, or neck and shoulders.  I chose feet.  Deep exhale.  No words can explain how amazing this was.  I didn't want my time to end, but it did... :(

There's nothing wrong with the location. Cityscape is a great spot in downtown Phoenix. Perfect for the busy lunch crowd, and Five Guys is open for dinner and on weekends. For a fast food burger in this area, it pretty much is as good as it gets. The location is very clean and the staff was very friendly. My walking distance options are Five Guys and McDonald's; Five Guys is always going to win that fight. 

As I stated earlier, the burger itself is good. I learned my lesson from the Scottsdale location, and ordered the Little Hamburger this time. It's a good size and not too unreasonably priced, but still more than I want to pay for a quick service meal. The huge amount of toppings are wonderful (but I cannot figure out how all the toppings are free yet cheese is an additional 60 cents). It's also a little too messy and greasy to me, but that's probably what appeals to others. 

The big problem I have with Five Guys is the fries. Why is there no small? The amount that comes in a regular order is way too much. While you certainly get the value of what you pay for in the quantity, there should be a smaller and cheaper option. You also do not get the value of what you pay for in quality. This time I experimented with the Cajun Fries. Just awful. Way too overseasoned and soggy. I left out the cup so my coworkers could finish them off. Not too many people seemed interested. 

A little more than seven dollars for a burger and an unnecessary amount of fries. No drink (had water back at my office). More money than I want to spend on greasy fast food.

From the houses to the market street, everything is top notch. 

Over the years, DC Ranch has taken a little turn. What started as the all-in-one community equipped with nightlife, day-life and living essentials, has transformed into more of a community without so much of the nightlife -- and I think that's a good thing. 

I will begin with Market Street. This is the area that has transformed over the years and with it, the nightlife style bars have vanished. I think this has allowed DC Ranch to turn into more of a homey community rather than the next Old Town. Several restaurants still line the streets, and very popular ones at that. On of my favorite wine bars is still there and there are several boutique retail stores. It's a nice shopping area to walk around on a weekend. 

Now moving on to DC ranch, the community. The houses in DC Ranch are like little castles. The architecture is pretty and the houses are private and in a community at the same time. Within the community, residents have a ""club"" equipped with a pool, playground, tennis courts and community area. This is perfect for families and makes it a community with real neighbors.

Although we didn't get to work with color in this particular class, the instructors safely guided us through the steps to make our own glass flowers.

Typically when I hear ""arts festival,"" I think of a few random artists in a park. However, this is something so much more. If you've been to the Culinary Festival, think of it like that but replace food with the art. Every inch of the Civic Center plaza (from AZ 88 to the end of the park near the library) was filled from head to toe with artist stations. Art ranged from modern sculptures and paintings that look like images, to some funky pop culture and artsy jewelery. There is something for every art lover at this festival and if you are any sort of a collector, you must add this festival to your list. I'm not even a huge art lover and I found extreme appreciation and respect for the artwork here. The artists are well-known world wide and you get to meet them first hand and ask them about their art. 

So of course there's art at an art festival, but what else is there? A lot! They had several food trucks like Sweet Republic and Epic. They also had food vendors such as a delicious kettle corn vendor. In addition, they served beverages all throughout the festival. A festival isn't complete without music and they had not one but two bands playing at different locations of the festival. Both bands were lively and perfect for the atmosphere. I noticed several activities going on, including arts and crafts for kids and journal writing workshops for kids and adults. They also had a silent art auction going on inside Scottsdale Center for Performing Arts. 

I enjoyed this festival mainly because it was organized and a quiet chaos. They did an excellent job organizing this event so that there was plenty to see, do and eat but it was spread out enough so that people weren't falling over each other. Tickets were only $7 for admission and it was free if you were a member of SMOCA.",review,8c2ZwD42Q30eUjxG2SgYNg

The location is a pro and a con. It is next to a movie theater. This means it makes a great meal before or snack after a evening flick. The downside is you are most likely going to walk a bit from your parking spot. 

The format is self serve. You order at the counter and they bring you your order, drinks spices etc the rest if up to you, so no need to worry about a big tip.

Is also is nice to see powdered garlic on the tables, this is a must that my NY pizza soul and it is great that I don't need to smuggle in my own garlic like I do at many other places.

To sum up this review, yes it was, but let me explain a little bit more in depth. 

The little cottage surrounded by welcoming tables and chairs in its front yard practically smiled at me as I walked up. It was around 4:25 PM as I walked through the doors. As I entered, the barista looked up and said they were closing. Tear. She must have noticed my look of disappointment, because she asked me what I was planning on ordering. When I mentioned that I was planning on getting an iced coffee, she pleasantly said that she could assist and welcomed me inside. Phew! So with that, the customer service earned this shop a point right off the bat. 

The coffee shop is intimate and quaint. It has the memory of the former tenants yet they've rearranged the interior to give it their own coffee shop twist. To the right, I noticed several small booths perfect for an afternoon of working. I was impressed at how many tables they fit inside, considering the size of the cottage. I wouldn't suggest that you meet here with your study group of ten, but if it's just you or maybe one or two others, it's a nice little spot! 

Baked goods such as muffins, pie and scones lined the counter. I was tempted, but I knew dinner was just around the corner so I fought temptation. Next time though! I ordered the medium iced toddy. Normally I drink iced coffee with non-fat milk and a hint of sugar free syrup. This toddy would have worked without either, but I couldn't avoid adding at least a little non-fat milk to it. The coffee was good and had the caffeine kick I needed to get me through the day. I also like the fact that they use Cartel products. 

I like Carmel's because it has the Downtown Phoenix coffee shop vibe for the Arcadia crew. It isn't stuffy in there, it doesn't feel like your typical corporate coffee shops that surround Arcadia and Scottsdale and it has a nice independent feeling that fills this cottage with character. Once I walked inside, I would have never guessed a Jack-in-the-Box was just next door. 

I think this is a perfect location for this coffee shop and it'll be nice to stop in and grab a drink and baked item...and probably stay and work for a little bit too!

Baba-Ganush is a fairly new (from what I can tell) Middle Eastern restaurant on Bethany Home Road. They also do the hookah thing, if you're so inclined, and have lots of flavored tobacco on sale. Their dessert case has baklava and other pastries on display.

I had their chicken shawarma plate, which came with pita, salad, and a side of their namesake babaganush. The chicken tasted great and was well cooked, and the babaganush was excellent as far as babaganushes go. The salad was basically iceberg lettuce, though, and I would have probably swapped it with one of the other sides (like hummus, tabbouleh, or rice). I also got a side order of tabbouleh, which was good - lemon slices on top to allow you to determine how tart you want it to be. 

The menu is standard Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food, including items like gyros, dolmas, and Greek salad.

Yes, those two words matters so much to me. Rula offers 1/2 off all appetizers and discounts on pints. What could be better? I say try the brie, for it comes with an unbelievable apple chutney. If you're looking to split an entree with a friend, opt for the lamb stew - served with a side of soda bread. The stew is hearty and the serving is huge. I've also had the shepherd's pie, which was pretty tasty. Way too large for one person, though. 

Also, I discovered that Rula can make ya a Raspberry or Chocolate Guinness. I don't know how either tastes, for I went with a plain (but satisfying) pint. I asked to sample the concoctions, but was told Rula doesn't let people sample liquors. Fair enough. 

If I could change one thing about this place (ok, maybe more than one thing), I'd have a larger beer selection - even sold by the bottle. I'd also make it less noisy and crowded at night. If you don't get there early enough to stake your spot, you're likely to be standing the entire time. That doesn't make for a very comfortable experience. Word to wise: take advantage of Rula's casual atmosphere and leave your ridiculously high heels at home.

It's great that Rula offers live music. I wish they offered more. Sure, the outside patio is great, but what if I'm in the mood to play darts? I guess I'll have to go to another bar for that... and for the beer I'm really craving.

The noodles were mixed with veggies like carrots, zucchini, cabbage, and onions and drenched in a very tangy citrus soy sauce.  The chicken however, was just placed on top with no sauce or anything.  Kind of weird.  I enjoyed it until about half way through when the sauce became too much for me to handle.  I'll just drain in next time.  I will probably be back, but maybe just to order way too many eggrolls to gorge on.",review,L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A

Jared ordered a ""turkey on rye, toasted, deli mustard, no mayo, swiss cheese, tomato, onion, pepperocini, and lettuce."" His sandwich came with his choice of side and a pickle.  He went for the three bean salad...

My gyro came on a different pita for some reason.  It was excellent.  I just don't understand why they don't serve their hummus with the pitas that they serve with their gyros.  Weird.

Well, it's hidden in the most delightful way and I wouldn't want it to be any other way. But if you really want to find it (and I don't know if I want to give the secret away), I will say that it's located just south of Indian School off of Goldwater. 

When a restaurant has a five star average and nearly 60 reviews, they've got to be doing something right. Cafe Monarch is no exception. After months of anticipation, Cafe Monarch finally reopened its doors after a summer hiatus and I couldn't wait to give it a try. Through yelp reviews, I heard that you come prepared to eat what the chef feels like making that day. Yelp friends, don't question the chef. He knows what he's doing. He knows what you want more than you yourself know what you want. 

I began my meal with a freshly made hibiscus iced tea. It was the perfect refreshment to enjoy the warm weather on the adorable patio surrounding the restaurant. Since this is BYOB, the chef mentioned that this iced tea is also quite tasty with some vodka in it, but since I had a long day ahead of me, I went the alchi-free route this time. Possibly dinner next time? The menu had a variety of items to choose from including a chicken pesto sandwich or salad and a prosciutto panini. I went for the chicken pesto sandwich after the chef said it was his favorite (and remember, don't question the chef's choices) and I couldn't have been more pleased. The chicken was roasted to perfection and moist with freshly made cheesy pesto giving it a hug. Situated on a freshly made french baguette, it was a treat to put in my mouth and I secretly didn't want the cuisine experience to end! To accompany the sandwich, the chef made a salad full of fresh cantaloupe, grapes and strawberries. I assume he makes salads based on the season and I was very happy the fruit season was upon us! The meal was perfect. It was light and satisfying in a perfectly peaceful setting. The house is adorable and I wish my own could resemble it. 

I think this could quite possibly be one of the perfect locations to dine on a lazy afternoon when I don't have a care in the world (or want to pretend that I don't). And before I go, I wanted to mention how nice the chef/owner is! He's very personable with his customers and makes each experience unique and delightful. I believe that delightful is absolutely the overall word to describe my experience at Cafe Monarch. 

Some things to note before you visit:

- Cash only, so come prepared. I had an iced tea and sandwich with a salad and it was around $16. 

- BYOB and if you forget, there's a Circle K just next door to buy some ""quality"" booze 

- Be prepared to relax and enjoy yourself. For being a one man show, the chef/owner does an excellent job of preparing a delicacy in a short period of time, but the atmosphere is so adorable you should plan on staying to enjoy it while you're there.",review,L-uPZxooP_ziXCtRrWi8Pw

The place was hoppin'!  It was 1pm, and there were actually two sections in this room.  While they had the same furniture, one area felt like a coffee shop, with the rounded counter adorned with cookies and deli cases filled with bottles of water and juices, and I don't know what else, since we decided to sit in the other section, which had a more ""open"" feel to it.  Large glass windows that allowed nature to envelope you, at least a little bit, and, I would have to say, it felt like a bustling bistro.

But finally, after getting tattooed for two and half hours I was too weak and exhausted to argue (I forgot how draining it is to bear down against pain for so long, whew).

So I show up at the pretty convenient location (on the outer edges of the always busy Trader Joe's/Changing Hands/Walgreens complex) oozing blood out of my shoulder and took the table by the window - suffice to say I was not in the mood for any antics, rude servers or other malarkey. I noticed a raised up area in the corner by the door that had more traditional seating - lower, round tables and a running cushioned booth along the wall, along with lower barrel type seats on the other side - but didn't feel like balancing while I ate since I could barely stand up. When my mom showed up, though, she wanted to move to that area, so we did and I was pleasantly surprised that it was pretty comfy and of sufficient height to not feel awkward.

The server did not aggravate my intolerance in the least. She was authentically Turkish, so much that we had a little trouble understanding her, but she was helpful and patient by way of explaining some of the more unfamiliar dishes (she's prob used to that). Which, by the way, I found were overall similar to entrees and foods that are recognizable if you've ever eaten at Pita Jungle and the like: falafel, hummus, feta, olives, fresh pita, tobouli and stuff that had different names but was similar to spanakopita and yogurt dressing ... all of which were on the Super Sampler, which we ordered to share.

Note: mom is gluten intolerant and could not eat the tobouli here - who knew there was wheat/flour in some tobouli??

Mom sampled a Turkish wine they had on the menu and immediately vetoed it - if you're feeling adventurous and want to get it, get a sample first. They had plenty of other wine and beer on the menu. Not sure about full bar, I was pretty out of it and in no mood for a cocktail. It was a Saturday night, and at about 7, the live entertainment started! A belly dancer complemented the stellar band of traditional instrumentalists. That was sort of tucked into a separate room, so if you're not into it, you can sit far enough away to ignore.

All in all, this place was charming, right down to décor and the authentic servers and entertainment,  and totally unique. That's not a word I ever use, but charming totally sums it up. And, how cool would you look if you took your date here instead of the super trendy Pita Jungle - with free entertainment to boot? Then mosey to Changing Hands to look at books ... perfect date spot indeed.",review,c-qtFVPutboIiJASZYrwuA

Despite the uncomfortably hot temperatures, we ventured out to the Waterfront to take in our share of taco goodness.  I was a little miffed by the admission price of $10 per person, but went in with high hopes.  Like others said, there was a distinct lack of shade, and it was also very dusty and a lot of dry grass was being kicked around in the air, making for a very extensive sneezing experience there!  The tacos were fairly small, street taco size, for $2 (1 ticket) a taco.  We arrived around 3:30-4 P.M. and unfortunately some of the taco vendors had already sold out of their tacos, which limited our selection.  They had also sold out of diet soda.  

I was annoyed that a volunteer continually harassed me at the drink booth telling me I needed to go get my ID checked at a totally different section of the booth when I had told him multiple times that all I wanted was a soda.  He had made it seem like a very big deal that I was getting a drink there without ID check (Even though I am WELL over the age of 21!).  I was very close to the front of the line, so I was NOT going to get out of line on a very hot day when there are huge lines to get my ID checked just to get a stinking soda!  When I went to the front to order my soda, the ladies taking tickets and getting drinks didn't care how old I was, why should he?  After I left with my soda, the volunteer stopped me again, saying ""Oh, so they let you get the drink?""  Well... yeah, I have it in my hand, so yes (Was that not obvious?).

In general, I'm glad I went to this festival to say I did experience it, but I don't think I'll be going again in the future.  There is a lot of room for improvement that still can be done, plus I go to festivals to have fun, not to get harassed if I want a soda at a booth that sells alcohol.",review,LaNjC1TOvprQUNkQ9Rio8g

The Fairmont Scottsdale, formerly known as the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, was one of those shining examples of upscale greatness with its Marquesa and La Hacienda restaurants. With new owners came new ideas, and both establishments were shuttered to make way for culinary concepts, including the fantastic Bourbon Steak by Chef Michael Mina. 

Now, with the help of chef Richard Sandoval, La Hacienda is re-opening with an updated look and menu.

Sandoval grew up in Mexico City working with his restaurateur father. His upbringing helped to fuel a passion that led to multiple accolades and a reputation for innovative Latin cuisine. He opened his own restaurant in 1997 and over the years he's opened several more star-awarded restaurants.

La Hacienda has always been known for great margaritas. The traditional La Hacienda ($10) is still the tops, but one of the new comers, the El Pina Diablo ($11) uses pineapple and serrano chile infused tequila and is refreshing and subtly spicy. 

In the bar, the daily happy hour runs from 5 to 7 p.m. and features $5 margaritas and snacks ranging from guacamole to tacos.

The dinner menu has been designed to combine ""the bold taste of classic Mexican cuisine with timeless European cooking techniques."" Starting at the top, you can't go wrong with crunchy Chips and Guacamole ($9.50). The appetizer was fresh and delicious, thanks in part to the tableside preparation of the guacamole. Diners can request their preferred level of spiciness while severs prepare the guacamole.

The Queso Fundido ($9) is served in a searing hot cast iron skillet for good reason -- to keep that cheese molten. A winning combination of melted Oaxaca, Chihuahua and Monterrey cheeses, with chorizo or mushrooms atop, fills the soft house-made flour tortillas perfectly.

Ceviche is one of those dishes that can be disastrous or outstanding, Sandoval and Hamrick served up the latter. The Ceviche Tasting ($10) offers two selections tender rock shrimp with avocado accented with chile habanero or mahi mahi, bathed in a citrus tomato broth, and hinted with just enough chile serrano for another layer of flavor. Both were outstanding, especially when tasted with the accompanied bowl of house-made corn nuts. It's a great texture!

Ever heard of huitlacoche? Also known as corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on corn and is considered a delicacy in Mexico. Call it whatever you like, it's delicious earthen taste shouldn't be missed when eating the Tamal de Huitalcoche ($9). A tamal is the same as tamale, though in this case the masa has been infused with the complex flavors of the huitalcoche, filled with goat cheese and zucchini and drizzled with truffle oil. I felt like a Mayan king eating this.

After trying the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Salad ($12), I felt confused. With so many original dishes, why bother with a salad like this? While the ingredients were top notch and it tasted fine, the ordinariness left me scratching my head. 

Making up for this was the Quesadilla ($9), which might sound typical, but after one bite that idea was dispelled. With various fillings, these crispy-on-the-outside, dreamy-on-the-inside quesadillas made for great dipping into the red and green salsas. Fantástico!

Huachinango a la Veracruzana ($26) is a traditional Veracruz style red snapper dish. This gorgeous piece of fish gets a spin with the smoked bacon fufu. A mash of plantains had just enough sweet to balance out the acidic flavor of the tomato, olive and caper sauce.

My favorite entrée, and an instant classic, was the Costilla de Res ($27). The melt-in-your-mouth beef short rib was not only braised, but received a second flavor enhancing method in a smoker. The generous serving of meaty richness was countered by a creamy potato puree and chile habanero and guava sauces.

Desserts are surprisingly light yet still satisfyingly delicious. The Flan de Coco ($9) was perfectly luscious and silky. By contrast, the Churros ($9) had a delightful crunch with a sponge-like interior that absorbed the three different dipping sauces perfectly. La Hacienda also offers house-made ice cream ($8) that includes an avocado version that so good, you might ask for another scoop.

After dessert, coffee is spectacular. The server wheeled out a cart and became not only a mixologist but a pyrotechnician. The columns of burning cinnamon are so beautiful and leave a wonderfully smoky cinnamon smell lingering. These chocolaty rich coffee libations might be a little over the top and full of liquor, but they really shouldn't be missed.

If you have a little too much to drink at La Hacienda you are at one of Scottsdale's finest resorts. Perhaps you can book a night in one of their romantic rooms and make it a mini staycation.

The team at La Hacienda has done a great job paying close attention to the past, but they've set in motion an evolution for a bright and tasty future.",review,Gy7ERh2GhmAYMZMO48ztBg

I took a couple friends in town from San Diego here some weeks back for a pre-Chez Nous banquet. Man, you have no idea how much I was looking forward to eating at the Fry Bread House after driving past this joint countless times. Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a politically incorrect, diabetes-inducing culinary wondercarb, but I still had to have some.

First off, it's a very casual place run by members of the Tohono O'odham Nation and the prices are pretty cheap. I looked at the menu and wanted to eat everything, but I decided to be good and *only* got myself the green chili Indian taco. I forget what my friends had, but we then split a fry bread with honey & powdered sugar for dessert.

And can I tell you, it was all so good going down. I sat there all content while listening to Michael Bolton's ""How Can We Be Lovers If We Can't Be Friends?"" oozing out of the soundsystem. 

But then something happened. Something bad. My internal orchestra went into overdrive and I had to make a mad dash for the bathroom. 

SO, the lesson being, for all you digestively normal members of the human population, relax! Come eat here! It's really good! Just don't eat here too often, or your body will hate you. 

And as you for lactose intolerance sufferers, you're well aware that your body already hates you. I don't know what I ate here that caused my gut to go into a tailspin, even after downing 3 Lactaid pills. I'm usually great with eating cheese (pizza? no problem), but I'm assuming the cheese they used in taco was the culprit. Unless they cooked everything in clarified butter instead of lard or oil. Then that would explain things. So if milk has unfortunately become your enemy in recent years, proceed with caution.

Not that it was near where we lived, as all of us were in North Phoenix, but it was because we wanted it to be ""special"" than the other normal times we ate at the same Mexican food restaurants.  

I think that is the highlight of this location.  It's a little different than other locations.  They have great happy hour specials.  Things get insane on Cinco de Mayo (at least 2 years we just ate at the bar because we couldn't even get a table).  It's Macayos level food, and a slightly more interesting physical location.

I'd heard of Tossed before (maybe because it was voted ""NYC's best salad"" by New York Magazine.) Or, maybe because my friend opened a similar concept called Dressed in Atlanta... either way, I'm the kind of girl that loves a big salad for lunch, and I'm psyched to have a place like tossed here in Arizona...

As of today, October 10, Tossed has been open just over a week. So I know I can't be too tough on them... when we went a few days ago, they were still getting used to being open. Even so, it was a positive experience.  The space itself is pretty large for a salad restaurant.  I think it used to be an Arizona Bread Company - I hope it does well at this location as I'd love for it to stay!

I was with my brother; I asked if he'd join me for lunch at tossed since I really wanted to try it.  We walked in and figured out to go to the side that was to order in (as the other side was for catering and take out orders) - it was kind of confusing, but we later learned (from Gazwan Paulus, the Area Developer) that bigger signs are on their way.

Since I'd picked up one of the tossed menus before we went, we both were somewhat familiar with it, but it still took me a few minutes at the register to design my own salad from their huge list of ingredients.  Zack chose from the list of ""specialty salads and creative interpretations of familiar favorites"" and ordered the Southwest Blackened Chicken Salad.  I finally chose my unique combo of greens, chick peas, chopped tomato, avocado, turkey, and maybe celery.  I also suggested to Zack that we order one of their whole wheat crepes (that are made fresh in the store to create crepe wrap sandwiches) to share.  After we ordered and payed, we were given a # to bring to the table - I do like the fast casual concept.  However, it was not until after we ordered that we were able to actually see all of the ingredients in front of us - I may have chose differently after seeing everything laid out in front of me...

Regardless, it was only a matter of minutes before  our beautiful salads were delivered to us.  Presentation was beautiful, service was friendly, and best of all, our salads were delicious!  I'd taken the suggestion from Tori (the girl who took our order) to taste the Strawberry Balsamic Vinaigrette as my dressing and it was delicious - Thanks again, Tori!  We were both pleased with what we ordered; the crepes were a light, chewy, unique texture that we both really enjoyed as well.  Somehow a bite or two of cheese made it into my salad which isn't the end of the world, but I knew I hadn't ordered it- I'll let it go since they are still so new.

There are a ton of other salads that I look forward to designing at tossed and I cannot wait to go back for more!  You may want to check it out online before you go as the menu can be a bit overwhelming.  Prices range from $6.95 - $10.95 but can get even more expensive if you like to add a ton of ingredients.  I'd plan on spending about $10 per person on average.  Not so bad... oh, and they also soup, smoothies, and sweet treats including freshly baked cookies, brownies, and fruit - there is something for everyone.

As we were leaving, we met the Area Developer I spoke of above and he was really nice... he wanted to make sure we had a good experience and he told us of their plans to build locations of tossed all around the Valley.  I hope they will consider coming to Old Town because that's where I'll be soon!",review,sry6XEVOqIDLoJRaXAMKjA

I finally decided on a bowl of soup (shrimp and corn chowder) and the Ancho Pork empanadas.   In hindsight 2 rich choices but both quite tasty.  
The soup had at least 5 good sized shrimp, perfectly tender in a creamy base that was seasoned well and just enough spice to warm and not overwhelm the palate.  
The empanadas had seasoned pork, with a flavor similar to chorizo (garlic, chile, cumin), the crust was a flaky puff pastry.  This was served with a sweet citrus pepper marmalade that complimented the empanada well.

I have a good number of places to eat that are all within walking distance or along the lightrail.  This little gem of a place on Roosevelt has been a favorite of mine and the husband's.  It's a tiny little place with minimal parking in the back, but it packs a punch for it's size.

Inside you will find a small but comprehensive selection of some Italian staples that may be more difficult to find in other areas.  They have pizzelle, anise, spices, and even some specialty imported tomato sauces.  Their meat and cheese selection is also small but comprehensive. Everything always looks fresh and tasty.  They keep everything in smaller quantities so I take comfort in the fact that they aren't selling me old crappy food.  

When we eat here, I typically get the gnocchi.  Now, it certainly isn't the best.  I'm pretty sure it has been previously frozen, or maybe the same stuff that they stock on their shelves.  However, it's still a tasty gnocchi.  Tender potato dumplings sit in a pool of yummy marinara sauce.  I'm not typically a fan of marinara sauce, but in this case, I love it.  It's a really simple sauce with just the right amount of basil and oregano to remind me of what Italian food should taste like.

I once got the chicken salad sandwich here.  I love chicken salad and will usually try it when presented with the opportunity.  Unfortunately, I really did not like this kind.  It was a little on the dry side for my taste, but man was this SPICY!  It was overwhelming to me, maybe in part to the fact that I was not expecting it.  However, the husband finished it off and really really enjoyed it.

Finally, anything with meatballs on it from here is a solid choice.  They are big and flavorful with a delicate blend of spices mixed in.  I'm not sure if they use meat other than beef in there, but I have a feeling they might use lamb.  Yum.

I frequented Scratch when they first opened a couple of years ago but this little hidden cafe had unfortunately fallen off my radar as of late -- until today that is. While out and about on the town, my tummy started to rumble and I decided to take advantage of my iPhone yelp app to possibly find a sandwich spot that might not be top of mind. Scratch showed up and immediately memories came back. So I turned my car around and made a long overdue visit to Scratch. 

Scratch is an intimately small bakery slightly hidden within a shopping center on Miller and Indian School. But all it takes is one step inside for the character to appear. The space itself is small and relatively bare with minimal furniture, decorations or food on display. But once you glance at the menu and read the options you realize that the food is well thought out and of great quality. 

During my most recent visit, I opted for the turkey and avocado sandwich but I added Brie. I ordered the sandwich to-go and it was ready within minutes. The sandwich came with a mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette and I was ecstatic when I realized that they wrap the sandwich in saran wrap to save it from picking up any moisture from the salad. I wish that every sandwich shop did this because I can't tell you how many times I've had a sandwich with soggy bread because it wasn't separated from the sides. So thank you for that little special treat, Scratch! 

Moving on to the sandwich quality itself, tres bien is all I can say. The white bread was extremely soft and had obviously been made that day. The avocado was fresh and buttery and the perfect addition to the sandwich. The turkey was sliced and tasty and the sandwich in its entirety was delicious. Simply but delicious, just like the decor at Scratch. The balsamic vinaigrette was quite tasty as well and while the salad was lacking anything else besides two tomatoes, it was still nice to get some greens with the meal. 

While this was a great sandwich and I've also enjoyed the pastries and beverages from past visits, you do pay for the quality of food you receive. My sandwich alone without a drink or additional side was $10+. In other cities that might be reasonable but for Phoenix, it's definitely on the pricier side when you don't have a drink accompanying the price tag. But like I said, you pay for the quality of food and the quality of the sandwich was worth the $10 out of my wallet.

Avocado translates to a spread.  I forget that every time and order it the next thinking I'm getting the real deal.  Last time, I actually thought they missed it.  I didn't see it, I didn't taste it.  But at the very last bite, I spotted a small green dot of it on the end of the bread.

Potato salad is commercially packaged.  Same brand some of the grocery stores carry.  I'm sure I'll forget that as well and order it again, be disappointed, etc.  I would prefer they not offer it at all if they can't make it in-house.

We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!

1. Convenience 
2. Price 
3. Location 
4. Wait time 

1. Convenience 

The Carwasher is conveniently located in the heart of Old Town. I pass by the car wash several times a day and it's always a friendly reminder that I really should keep my car more squeaky clean. So when I do decide to take the plunge, chances are, I'm not too far from The Car Washer. In addition, it's located next to a CVS and coffee shop so if I opt for the more detailed wash, I've got options besides waiting on the rock wall. 

2. Price 

Depending on the wash mood my car is in, I can go with a wash as cheap as $4 or as expensive as $80. The $4 wash is excellent because it's an in and out exterior car was but not your normal run of the mill cheap wash. They do a great job on the exterior and I leave happy on the outside. When I decide to make my interior look just as sparkly clean, they offer detailed car washes for a relatively reasonable price. Since I do interior far and few between, I normally go the middle of the road price range when I do get a car wash, but if I was smart and more frequently, I could get the inside and outside done for around $17. 

3. Location 

Location and convenience go hand in hand but as I mentioned in #1, the location is prime and chances are, people drive by The Car Washer and don't even realize it's there. Like I said, it's in the heart of Old Town and within walking distance of practically everything. 

4. Wait time 

And finally, wait time. They are thorough with their cleaning and they don't skimp on the detailing if you go for the pricier option. However, for the level of work they do and the detail they put into it, they do so in a relatively short amount of time. For a detailed car wash, it's about a 30 minute wait time, but if you go for a cheaper car wash, it's only about 10 minutes.",review,L5VXsEEjf7BOgVPEtRTF8w

It's a small, clean restaurant and they put some money into marketing with a big fancy sign, and a text message club, etc. Our server was helpful, but not very nice and very indifferent toward us. We were the only ones in the restaurant, so it wouldn't have been tough to just be nice to us and give us quality service.

I was with my family and we ordered dinners. I ordered the pork rib and brisket dinner with black eyed peas and mac and cheese. Dad had the pork rib dinner with red beans and fried cabbage, and mom ordered the rib tip and brisket dinner with black eyed peas and red beans. Waitress came back about ten minutes after we ordered saying they were out of pork ribs and I got the last order, so my dad had to change his to pulled pork, then five minutes later they said they were out of pulled pork. I told the waitress they were going ot have some angry people if at 5PM before dinner time they were already out of pork. 

We all agreed about the food, because we all tried each others. Mac & Cheese was the best I've ever had, black eyed peas were delicious, red beans amazing, fried cabbage was great! all of the sides were top notch. Our entrees were kind of average at best, though. Mom and I agreed the brisket was tough, chewy, and very poorly prepared. None of us enjoyed the pork ribs or the rib tips. The gristle/fat to meat ratio was probably 80/20. 

It seems like they need to figure out how to prepare BBQ at this restaurant, because they have a lot of other dishes down pat. I'd go again but I'll try something different than BBQ... maybe a breakfast dish which I hear they are good at.",review,L3qC7bMuRBxqDtUnZ6G0tg

I would have never considered this place (because of its location and I had never heard about it before) if it weren't for my fiance who had read a review and decided that we should give it a try.  To my amazement, this place is actually very cool!  I can't think of another place like it anywhere.  I have tried about 4 or 5 of their pasties and they have all been excellent.  I can only describe them as ""calzones filled with awesomeness"".  There has to be at least 15 different ones to choose from and they are all probably very tasty.  I cannot vouch for how healthy the things are, but they are very good.  At about 7ish dollars for a pasty they are a good value because they fill you up quite nicely.

With my meal, I usually get a salad (their dressing is amazing), the mashed peas and the roasted potatoes.  Sometimes I can't help but have one (or more) of their $3 Irish car bombs.  The salad, peas and potatoes are enough to share with 2-3 people, but keep the car bombs for yourself!

My only complaint about this place is the seating.  If you have a party of 3 or more you just shouldn't go there.  Not only is the place tiny, the tables are only for 2 people.  I think they only have 1 or 2 tables that can accommodate more.  There is a bar area and that is where I dine because the tables are usually filled.

Our new thing is to pre-order a few pasties.  They have them ready in just a few minutes, you pick them up, then pop them in your own oven.  This way we don't have to worry about seating.

Instead, I find myself very frustrated and I must remove a star from my review. 

Two reasons: 

Here's the crux of my beef: I like the peanut butter flavor. They offer chocolate peanut butter every Monday but I don't want CHOCOLATE peanut butter. Mind you, they have chocolate frosty every day AND, this past Monday, they had sugar-free chocolate in the SAME MACHINE as chocolate peanut butter (AND chocolate frosty was still an option in another machine!). 

I haven't seen the plain peanut butter in quite a while, and I know I'm not the only person who's been asking for it. (It's especially good with any of the berry flavors - like a PB&J!) The fact that they load up the machine weekly with a flavor that customers could ""mix"" themselves and deny the rest of our requests for the straight up peanut butter makes absolutely NO sense to me. 

So, fine: it's your yogurt shop. You pick the flavors. At least let me know if it's worth the drive. I'm willing to tell you exactly what will make it worth it for me: knowing there's at least one flavor I want. (And, it doesn't even always have to be peanut butter!) 

I have asked and suggested (and have overheard others doing the same) that the day's flavors be posted on a website, facebook or twitter. The response was that it was not practical because they couldn't be updating all day long and they didn't want a customer to be mad if they came for a particular flavor that was posted but had run out. I don't agree (Ahem, it's the digital age, people! You're not sending the Pony Express out with an update.), but I can understand the concern. 

Instead, I was encouraged to provide my cell phone number to be associated with a particular flavor and I would be sent a text message the next time that flavor was available. I don't know the mechanics of blasting a text but it seems that would be a lot more time consuming (or at least equally) than updating a fan page on facebook or posting a tweet. 

Also, by the way, once they've texted me, my number would be crossed off the sheet and I'd need to ""re-request"" to be notified. Talk about inefficient! 

Yogurtology has great flavors available to them. The bar and shop are clean. They could totally be five stars. I want to be able to give them five stars but I can't. In fact, as a regular customer, I'm so disappointed I can't even stand by my ""yay! I'm a fan."" Right now, in my book, they're ""A-OK."" If I'm going to go for frozen yogurt, this is where I'd go. And, I'd pray I'd be delighted to find a flavor I love in one of the machines... but, I wouldn't know until I got there.

It's always sooo crowded in here, filled with tons of LA Fitness goers, fresh from a workout. Grabbing a cart is usually a waste of time and an annoyance when trying to maneuver through the throngs of people milling about in each aisle, I opt for basket I can carry. 

The quality of their food here is awesome. Fresh vegetables, lovely meats and cheeses. Their hummus comes in every flavor from plain/original to guacamole (Yes, guacamole hummus!) and their tzaziki  rocks, when I am not up to making my own. 
My favorite reason to go to Trader Joe's (other than their luscious mini peanut butter cups) is to pick up premade appetizers for gatherings, mini quiche, onion tarts, cocktail wieners in puffed pastry, meatballs.

The Mr and I shared a salad and a Cuban sandwich.. the control freak in me of course got off on the salad making.. this was probably the best salad Ive made to date.. you should be able to patent your creations!

I spent the most of this morning running errands and getting some shopping done, and had worked up an appetite.  I was to hungry and tired to go home and fix something, so I cruised into Jersey Mike's for a sub.

The place itself is clean!  Nicely decorated, with ample amounts of seating.  They have a few tables outside, but I ate indoors since it was a brisk 95 degrees today.  I went with the #9, which is the club (I think.)  It came with Turkey, roast beef, cheese, and all the toppings.   The menu listed that it also came with bacon as well.

Well, when I ordered, I told the guy NO BACON.  He was fixing a few other subs at the same time, and as I was watching him, I saw him put a strip of bacon on what I thought was my sub.  He also forgot to add mustard as well.  When I got his attention, I asked him of the sub at the end was mine.  He said yes, and I requested that he remove the bacon, which he did.  He also added my mustard, thank goodness.

Anyways, I got chips and a drink with it, and all around, it was tasty.  Not a bad deal, really. I'm glad I went!  I also got a cookie too, free of charge.  The guy who was running the register handed out cookies to us, as I think it was time for him to rotate a few fresh ones in.

I always loved this place to begin with because it showed independent and foreign films, which are my preferred genres. To add to that I was in a long-term relationship with a French girl, and since I've always loved French flicks anyway we came here almost every couple of weeks to see whatever was the latest hit out of Paris. 

Unfortunately my most recent visit was not such a great memory, through no fault of the theatre. I came last month when I was with my visiting brother and mom. Mom had originally expressed a desire to see Seinfeld's ""Bee Movie"", but since it got some lukewarm reviews and we knew that she typically likes suspense thrillers, we opted for ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"" playing at Camelview instead. 

Um. How can I put this delicately? How about... the opening scene of ""Before the Devil"" consists of an overweight Philip Seymour-Hoffman banging the shit out of Marisa Tomei. Doggy-style of course. For 2 or 3 straight minutes. After banging her, they both rolled over onto their backs and discussed how strong of an orgasm Philip had. 

Picture watching this opening scene with your mom. Also picture your mom being a traditional, prim and proper 63-year old woman from India. As the scene unfolded my brother and I glanced at each other horrified. About 5 minutes later, I dared to look over to see how Mom was doing and the look of pure, unadulterated revulsion on her face is something I've never seen before. Stifling my laughter I asked what she thought of the movie so far. Which was a mistake, because she very loudly responded so every audience member around us could hear, ""WHAT IS THIS FILTH? I'M GETTING OUT FROM HERE AND GOING HOME, NOW!"" With chuckles coming in from everyone around us, I somehow managed to convince her to stay. About 20 minutes or so later, when the very interesting plot of this fantastic film had further been revealed, I glanced at her again. Incredibly, that look of pure revulsion was still there. I think it was permanently frozen on her face for the entire evening.

Although I've never visited their original locations in Jersey and Philadelphia, I heard through the grapevine how delicious their ice and custards were. So when I realized there was one in Arcadia, I was excited to stop in for a taste! Let me say that I was more than pleased with the ice! 

The lovely ladies were more than eager to give me samples of the different flavors (that rotate throughout the month) and they said that the flavors tasted exactly like their name. Swedish Fish? We'll see if the taste matches the flavor, I thought, and wow! I seriously felt like I was eating a Swedish Fish minus the chewiness. The flavor was exactly like the candy. Cotton Candy and S'mores followed suit and tasted exactly like their names as well! It's pretty unbelievable considering it's an ice! 

With every spoonful, I felt immediately refreshed and learned that it has something to do with how the ice's are made. Instead of using ice and adding flavor, they make the flavor with liquid and then freeze it to make the ice. This is why the flavors are so fresh! 

After tasting several flavors, I ended up leaving with a cup of a combination of cherry and lemonade. The flavors complimented each other wonderfully and it was the perfect way to continue my day without melting in the heat! I also ordered a pint of cherry (red), a pint of blueberry raspberry (blue) and a pint of lemonade (white), for a 4th of July BBQ (I hear it goes great with some vodka too!)",review,xymCilKjW4I64hMIt2TouA

Biking up and down the hills can really give you a run for your money without even realizing it.. until it's too late :) Not that I know this from experience. I definitely don't give up.

There are plenty of shelters and picnic areas that you can use if open or reserve. I always see birthday parties and events going on while I'm there. Another common sighting is people watching and feeding the ducks. I always stop to see the babies.

There's so much to offer from basketball courts to green areas, playgrounds and picnic shelters. One of the activities I keep wanting to do but never remember is take a trip on the peddle boats. Someone remind me in a few weeks to do this. Or fall :)

Most of the weekend days bring some type of festival or event that makes the park too crowded for me.

I've been putting off going to this location, and finally got around to getting in there tonight. Unfortunately, I had a bad service experience, and, even though I will probably return, I'm upset after tonight with this specific location.  Here's why:

I got here around 5:30 and went with the all american burger with a haystack of onion rings.  There wasn't a whole lot of people in the place when I got there, but it soon started to fill up after I sat down and started to eat.

Halfway through my meal, I had finished my drink and needed a refill. I also figured since the onion rings were small, I would also grab a fork while I was up at the beverage station.  Mind you, the place was full at this point. 

I stood up, took my purse, grabbed my drink and walked to the beverage station.  As I turned around, I saw one of the bus boys clearing my table. My burger wasnt even half eaten.  I started to go after him to leave my food, and he did not hear me.  He walked right by me with my dinner and continued on into the kitchen.  I was FURIOUS.  I had just paid $10 for a full meal, and this kid was taking it away.  (it was half the burger and half the fries, not the whole burger.)

While he walked into the kitchen, I grabbed one of the burger girls and told her what was going on.  I explained that I had gone to the drink station to get more pop and this kid took away my food and I wasnt done.  She told me to hold on a second, and grabbed the kid (who appeared to be in high school) and told me to tell him what I had told her.  I explained to him that I was NOT DONE EATING and he had taken away the rest of my dinner.  He apologized, as did the server.  I was still upset, and told him I didnt want an apology, I wanted the the rest of my dinner!

They offered to cook me up another burger and fries.  I decided to pass, as I was mostly full from what I had already eaten.  I asked them to get the manager and the kid ran in the back of the kitchen and never came back out.  I wanted them to know what had happened, so that way they would know.

I left and called the store when I got home and talked to the manager. I explained that I was upset, as anyone would be, and had wanted to talk to her about it in person, but the kid who went to get the manager never reappeared. It was upsetting for me all the way around.

The manager apologized and took my name and number.   They said that if I come in, I can have a gift certificate for a free meal there, which is what I had wanted in the first place.

Anyways, even though I love the food here, I dont know that I will be back to this specific location any time soon, due to this whole thing.",review,R1kKjAO5kZO6d0gQGqrvGA

I went with a group of 7 on Tuesday night for dinner and 6 out of 7 of us loved it... sorry again, Marc - I felt awful that we all enjoyed and you did not.  Let me explain:

Since I'd been to the 16th street location before, i suggested Bombay Spice to mix things up a bit.  The group I was with are pretty healthy health conscious so I thought they may enjoy Indian food done healthy...

We shared the chickpea ceviche as an appetizer and then most of us ordered the different rice bowls as entrees.  We had fun with the variety of sauces too.  Favorite choices included the cauliflower, eggplant, chicken tikka masala, and veggie tofu tikka as well as the mint, hot, and curry sauces.  Unfortunately, Marc is allergic to onions and everything he attempted to order had onions in it.  By the time he placed an order for plain chicken and rice, we were all almost done and the kitchen was slammed and didn't prioritize his order (as they should have).  So, Marc didn't eat.  :(

I will return for sure for the food - it's prepared for the health conscious eater and it is not as heavy as traditional Indian Food - I happen to like that!

Um, ok. Does that mean I should turn around and walk out? Does it mean I get my food in 15 minutes and be expected to inhale it in 3 and then pay in the other two? Or do I get it to go? 

In any case, it wasn't the owner saying this. It was a college kid, probably more interested in the finer aspects of life, like playing some serious PS3 or watching Family Guy reruns. It was hot outside and I wasn't all that motivated to try and think of where else nearby to eat (it wasn't going to be PF Chang's, I can tell you that much). 

""I'll get a chicken kebab plate with rice & hummus to go, then.""

In the interim, I got to survey the inside. Some random Arabic Islamic calligraphy here and there, interspersed with bright splashes of Suns colors on the walls, Suns pennants, and countless photographs of loyal patrons all over by the register. There seemed to be pleasant enough seating outside, too - although I don't know if they have water misters for the summer heat or not. 

I eventually got my food and brought it home. Two grilled spears of chicken kebabs, ample rice and hummus, two pitas, and a little container of, WOAH! THAT'S GARLIC! sauce.

I prefer to avoid Paradise Bakery, and hit up other sandwich spots for lunch. I find their food good but a little overpriced. But today, I decided it was convenient to stop by Tempe Market Place on my way home from work, and I wanted a sandwich, so why not? 

I realized right away that this PB has a smaller menu than some of the others that I've hit up. That was an instant minus. I don't go to Paradise often enough to notice something like that. I settled for a Chicken Artichoke Panini. It was mediocre at best. On the plus side, it comes with a chocolate chip cookie. PB's cookies are a 100/10. 

I'm also not a fan of the set up of this location. If you don't have a table and/or are getting something to go, the only place to wait for your food is a small area in the middle of restaurant.  It's extremely awkward, and you always feel like you're in someone's way.

Decent food.  Not incredibly innovative, but still more ambitious than the rest.   I especially like their sausage and caramelized onion pizza, or the pepperoni with crimini mushroom pizza.  Also, the wines by the glass are surprisingly well picked and easy on the wallet.  Make sure to try the spinach, pancetta and goat cheese salad.  It's really tasty.

 First of all, the layout is just kind of silly.  I totally understand that this is an olllldddd building, so you work with what you're given.  That being said, the entrance/exit is too small and the condiment line backs up into that exit.  It's really frustrating that people feel some need to create a single file line to get sodas, napkins, utensils and condiments when really, there is A LOT of room to share.  It's a really long condiment bar!  Second of all it's way out there for us.  Living in Downtown Phoenix makes the trek out to Gilbert pretty rough sometimes.  Finally, they wouldn't let me sub a smaller version of the green bean fries for regular fries, even though I was willing to pay more than the normal sub fee.

On to the good... The grilled cheese I got was really yummy.  It was made with really thick Texas Toast style bread, had some great cheese on the inside, and it was toasted/grilled just right.  It was a very hearty grilled cheese!  The green bean fries that I wanted just a single sized portion of turned out to be like 3 pounds piled high in a basket!  They were really good and garlicky, and for only 5 bucks a great value.  However, I really just wanted enough for myself because as it turns out, I continued eating them until I made myself sick.

4 stars with potential for 5. We went here for dinner on Monday.  Loved the space and decor - everything was tastefully done from the small sectional lounge area to the communal table to the small bar area (beer, wine AND liquor, btw).  It oozes neighborhood café with the small tables (seating about 30 or so) and the fact that we knew people at 2 of the 10 tables - so for a Monday night this place was hopping.

The owner Maizie and her father were a delight to talk to - answering questions we had about the menu and about the restaurant in general and checking up on us regularly.  My dining partner had the  1/2 pound bleu burger with buffalo sauce and I opted for the Santa Fe chicken Panini with a huge supple grilled chicken breast, jack cheese, guacamole and ortega chile.  The variety of sides make it possible to get creative - slaw, fruit, cottage cheese, hand cut potato French fries or noodle kugel (the sweet Jewish dish I opted for which came with raisins, cinnamon and sliced apples). 

Service was good, but could be better or more seasoned.  The server who handled us was OK.  We let him know when we received the check that he had forgotten to charge us for the soda and iced tea and he went back to fix the error.  Wow.  That's a first for me.  Typically places I've been to have waived the drinks when they've already given you the check.  No big deal, just unusual and a bit gauche.

They have a great wine and beer selection,  and a bar in the back where they have several beers on tap. 
They even carry some local produce and dairy items (Crows Farm, Superstition Farm were 2 I noticed).  
Yeah it may be cheaper to go elsewhere and I still have to go to Sprouts for my health foods and supplements but I can honestly say if I didn't have a car between, PHX Public Market, CVS and Oakville I could get by pretty well for quite a while. 

While I could see a F&E fitting in quite nicely downtown all I really need now is maybe a little Ma & Pa Health Food store to open up or for PHX PM to start carrying Supplements and other Health Food Items.

As gyms go this place offers what most people need but not what every one wants. 

It has free weights, machines, and cardio equipment and a single activities room with a few classes.  It makes up for the lack of extras with the low price.

My biggest complaints are the new hours, they close at 10pm on weekdays which is too early and 7pm on weekends again too early. Another problem is the upkeep of some machines and items, many machines and other work out aids could use replacement or repair.

In fact, I looked into attending Ai of Phoenix for a graphic design degree and decided it was not the path I needed (or wanted). The decision came, though, after a couple months of trying to sort things out with them. I applied. I met with a career counselor. I had to submit some more paperwork. I went on a tour. I then was sent to meet a financial adviser, who had to be barely 18. That's when I realized that the majority of these students were young, inexperienced and knew to college life. I, on the other hand, already had a degree. I was looking to combine my past experience with a design degree to enhance my career. 

I also realized Ai isn't willing to working with professional students. They don't take into consideration your work schedule as much as they should, especially if they want to appear accommodating and understanding to students who are truly committed to going to Ai. Case in point: In order to get the ""a-ok"" to take only 9 credit hours a semester, I would have had to get the permission of the Graphic Design Faculty Advisor - or something. Ai really pushes a full-time schedule on its students, even if they offer evening classes. Silly. 

Plus, I didn't like being treated like an idiot. I mean, do I have to tell you over and over again that I already have a degree, that I know what to expect from paperwork and financial aid? Can you not see I'm annoyed at some 18 year-old who can't operate a computer to tell me what my cost would be per semester? Can you not tell I'm irked when I make known I'm on my lunch break, and I'm told it'll be another hour before we're finished? I don't like somebody wasting my time. True, I can be impatient. But this was ridiculous.

That's when I decided this place wasn't for me. Sure, I've heard great things about it, but the people who have gone here have told me I could have gotten a comparable degree and built a better portfolio somewhere else.

This place was great!  It's located right in Scottsdale, in the same shopping complex as Saba's Western Wear.  Its a small little boutique, cute, quiant and comfy.  It really felt like someones home.  Pink walls, lots of bras, and other odds and ends for women of all sizes.

This place caters to ALL women of every shape size and color.  They carry a full line of support for women who are full busted or not, along with post op breast surgery stuff as well.  They carry a full line of product.  They will even special order stuff for you.

On Saturdays, they are only open between 10-2, and closed on Sundays.  They advertise as being by appointment only, but you can walk in and shop just like I did.  I was greeted by a young lady who was professional in every way.  I asked her a lot of questions, and she was able to answer every single one for me.  I told her I just needed a few every day bras, nothing fancy or exciting.  

She had me step into a fitting room, and measured me for size.  She brought in a variety of bras, and I tried on each one to see what I liked best.  To my delight, most of the bras in the store were all reasonable in cost to what I would spend elsewhere...between $40-70 dollars.  

I should also mention that the measuring was obviously at no charge.  I was so thrilled to actually have someone who knew what they were doing during the entire session!  No pushy saleswomen, no bad information, no trying to upsell me on a bra I didnt want or need.  

I also found out that they have a location in Tucson, and that has been around for about 50 years, and thier Scottsdale location has been around for about 15 years.  Quite impressive.  

This place was totally what I needed.  Real service, by women who knew what they were doing, no pressure to by and I actually learned A LOT while I was there about bras and such.  Some of it I already knew, but some was new to me as well.

First off, I hate leases. I hate apartment complexes. I hate paying deposits and being treated as if I'll do damage before I ever move in. I'm no messy criminal. Good thing for me, the Mandarina staff treated me as if I were the mature, responsible and nice adult I am (for the most part). 

Of course, you think, ""They have to do that while they're trying to get you to sign."" Well, even after I signed a lease and moved in, the staff were helpful, considerate and friendly. I can honestly say that. And believe you me, I've had my run in's elsewhere with some pretty crabby management. 

Each month when it was time to pay rent, the staff made me a copy of my check and signed and dated it. Ah-ha. Proof, I thought. I never needed it, nor did I need to worry about getting my security and pet deposit back. After I moved out and cleaned my place, I did one final walk-through with the staff. I knew that day whether or not I'd be charged for anything. I wasn't, and my happy refund found its way to me in a matter of days. 

So, how was living there? Were there any problems? Of course there were. It is, after all, an apartment complex. You can't really choose your neighbors, although for a time, I lived next to some really cool guys who played football. I was sad to see 'em leave. 

Guest parking is a joke. Most of the parking is covered and reserved for residents, so any guest that comes over must come early enough to find a spot, or be okay with hoofing it from somewhere else. I guess you could always park in the Castle Boutique across the street. 

Let's talk gym/pool. I used both on a regular basis, especially the gym. It was always clean with fresh towels and cold water. The cardio machines aren't anything to brag about, but I sure did love having free weights at my disposable, along with a couple weight benches and leg presses. Plus, here's where you'll find a vending machine if you need your soda fix. As for the pool, I wouldn't say it's the cleanest since it's publicly shared. I didn' t see many people using it during the week, so I took advantage of after-work swims. You can have open containers, too, which is nice if you want to relax with a brew. Just don't ignore the pool rules. No glass allowed. I found out that! 

Inside, across from the gym, is what they call a Business Center. It has two computers with Internet access. You can check your email or Myspace 24/7 without too much of a wait. I wouldn't suggest saving your passwords or personal documents on the desktop, but I certainly ran across my fair share of interesting things... People who aren't moderately tech savvy should probably not use public computers. In any case, getting to the computers is easy. Sometimes you have to wait, for people bogart the machines. I guess it comes with the territory. 

Here comes my gripe. Maintenance - both interior and exterior. I never once had my single call for maintenance answered. I un-clogged my own bathtub and said ""to hell with it"" regarding the broken ice machine. Whatever. I found you can't really rely on this place to fix things, unless they're absolutely necessary. As for the landscaping, it's okay. I don't understand why they water the grass and trees every night, creating a swampland. Makes no sense to me. Nor will I ever be a-okay with landscapers waking me up at 6:30 a.m. to trim hedges. 

But, looking back over the 12 months I lived there, I have to say 98% positive things to say about Mandarina. They are a bit overpriced, but if you can afford it, it's a pretty good place to live, especially since you'll get your own Washer and Dryer in your unit. 

The location is great if you don't mind being nestled around business parks and buildings. There's places to eat at Priest/Washington and 48th/Washington. You'll have easy access to the 202 and 143 also. The light rail runs right in front of the complex, so that can be a plus or minus, depending on how you look at it. At first, I was thrilled. Then I found out that the light rail won't stop at the Mandarina. So, I figured, why stick around when I can't play with the new city toy?

Prices more reasonable than the NORTH that used to be here, and weren't bad for what you get.  The ""pure"" Margarhita was authentic and tasty.

i was surprised to see all the places we had eaten before. i sometimes think we don't go out as much, but apparently we do.

AJ's had a desert table and fortunately, i was a stuffed piglet so i physically could not eat anymore, however, if was on death row, this is what i would request as my last meal. 

the museum was a great place to hold this event. it wasn't overly crowded and there was plenty of food and drink to go around. even water! there were cooking demonstrations to top it all off.

After all, what's the point of walking without drinking.  Otherwise, I would be driving the Art Walk and then they would have to change the name to Art Drive and no one would go.  So Central Grille with it's generous parking fit the bill.

We sat on the patio which is quite nice, once the table with the screaming brat exited.  By then, I really needed that drink.  They have a great happy hour with $5 glasses of house wine, $3.50 well drinks and import or draft beer.  The house wines were not appealing to me, but all of their wine prices are quite reasonable, although the by-the-glass selection is limited.

We ordered two appetizers at only $5 each.  However, they were small, so definitely order more than one unless you're the girl that never eats in front of your guy.  I'm not that girl.  We had the artisan cheese plate and the fig jam crostini.  The cheese plate included a blue cheese, a goat cheese, and a third soft cheese (some kind of cream cheese).  The cranberry-walnut bread was a nice touch, even if the cheeses were somewhat ordinary.  The fig jam crostini was so crazy delicious though with carmelized onion and melted gorgonzola as well.

My husband wanted dinner, but since I didn't think there would be sofas along the art walk, we opted to have only an entree, no side dishes.  I went with the stuffed salmon.  The stuffing was made with crab meat.  Unfortunately, the salmon was undercooked around the stuffing.  Had I been resting after dinner instead of walking, I might have actually sent it back, something I rarely do.

I've been to Tonto Bar & Grill a handful of times and I've never been disappointed.  Most recently, I went for lunch on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.  My BF and I sat outside and enjoyed the fresh air and beautiful view of the Rancho Manana Golf Course as we dined.  

I will agree with Francesca that this is a rustic but extremely classy restaurant.  It's warm and cozy inside and has the feel of a lodge but serves higher end cuisine... ""all natural"" meats and a variety of fresh salad, soups, veggies, breads, and desserts prepared daily.  I recently learned that Tonto uses many native AZ products and supports the Native SEARCH seed program (whatever that is but it sounds really great).

Back to my Sunday afternoon lunch...
After taking a while to peruse the menu and enjoying a fine basket of fresh bread and butter, we decided to share a large Cowboy Cobb Salad with Lemon Herb Vinaigrette and Crumbled Bleu Cheese.  The salad came with chicken, bacon, egg, tomato, cucumber, and an avocado fan on top.  It was the perfect size for 2 to share and they split it in the kitchen for us which made it easy.  Since we were hungry we each ordered a side item as well.  I had the acorn squash - it was seasoned just right and melted in my mouth... I would order it again and again - it tasted like candy!  I think Jared was envious of the squash since he kept coming back for more.  He ordered the barley and mushroom risotto as a side and he enjoyed it but it didn't compare to the acorn squash.

Service was pretty good although our side items were not brought out until at least 10 minutes after our salad.  The view of the golf course made up for that easily, as did the fact that we were in no rush. 

In past visits, I've tasted the salmon, scallops, and grouper as well as several of the veggies.  I love that the menu has so many options to choose from... there is something for everyone from the meat and potato lover to the strict vegetarian.

My suggestion would be to add a little bit more to the sandwich and salad selection and also to have some kind of ready-to-go tuna and/or chicken salad.  We settled on hummus and each got a field green salad and a package of pita bread.  Which brings me to the next suggestion - add tables outside for those that want to eat there!

Oh yeah, that's right. The sweet taste of victory! 

Does the Insight Bowl really deserve 5 stars? Well, no. But my alum won, so giving this year's bowl any less would just be, well, worthy of a brutal beating. And I don't want that.

My date and I showed up at Sun Devil Stadium about 1/2 hour before kick-off. We easily found our seats and settled in to watch the team bands do their pre-game thing. Then my date went to fetch us some beer. That's when we learned there's an AZ state law that you can only carry 32 oz of frothy goodness at a time. So, we split a Fat Tire before the game. 

Before the pigskin was tossed about, we had to endure some pretty weird activities, including military men parachuting onto the field, each carrying a flag and one carrying the game ball. Firecrackers exploded overhead to build excitement, I guess (although it got annoying really quickly when they'd fire 'em each time a team scored). Three military choppers flew by overhead. Was this really necessary? Of course not. After the smoke and 'cracker debris settled, a quartet sang the National Anthem. I think I would have preferred to hear Carrie Underwood, though. Uh, yeah. Seriously. At least she can sing.

Finally, OSU won the coin toss and the game was underway. I knew this wasn't going to be just any game... and sadly, I knew I was going to get annoyed by the people here, not to mention the fireworks. 

Oh, the OSU fans were great. Even the Indiana fans were tolerable. It was two other groups of people who made this experience less than stellar for me. One was the family clans - those who attended the game just to have something to do. Those who brought their young children and allowed them to slap people in the back of the head with those air-up stick things. Those who took over our row and, when we took a bathroom break and got another beer, said, ""Oh, you're back"" in such a way that I wanted to smack 'em silly. Of course we're back. This is MY bowl game and you've taken over my seat, buddy. Did you really think I'd leave at the start of 2nd quarter? Now, move it! 

Second group - and even more annoying - were the Sooners. I don't care that you're from Oklahoma. If you want to come to MY bowl game and semi-cheer on MY team, do it with respect. Don't prance around in your OU colors and start Sooner cheers. Don't tell me I can't do the standard touch down wave when my boys score. Don't tell me how to cheer. In fact, take your karma-sucking ugly asses out of the the stadium. You're not here to watch OSU win. You're here just to make your presence known, to try and overshadow the REAL Oklahoma state school. You're like the Yankees of college football. Nobody likes you, so leave. 

Whew. (end rant)

So, how was the game, you ask? It was great! OSU had some great special teams, as well as really good defense and offense that allowed us to score 44 points! GO POKES! *does the Cowboy gun salute*

It was a fantastic way to spend the afternoon, especially on NYE. I never thought I'd get to watch my Cowboys play in a bowl game, but never say never! My wish came true! I wish I had been surrounded by OSU fans, though. I wish I could have heard the Cowboys band. I wish I could have remembered the words to the school songs! Argh! But, nonetheless, I'm really happy that I got to go to the Insight Bowl. I had alot of fun!

We also had a sneak peek of the upstairs dining room, which is no longer upscale with white tablecloths. The owner, Sam Richardson (he also owns Richardson's and Dick's Hideaway) wanted the upstairs room to feel more laid-back and comfortable like it is downstairs so he changed the interior quite a bit apparently.

I was pretty impressed with their happy hour selections and prices.  The ladies had glasses of wine and the guys had a Kettle martini with blue cheese olives (my absolute fav!).  The martini was excellent especially because it was 6 bucks.  The wine pour was a bit skimpy though.

The 4 of us shared the crab cake appetizer and it was excellent and will definitely order it again.

For an entree I ordered the sliced fliet mignon burger sans bun.  It is exactly as it sounds; basically a sliced filet mignon.  It was pretty thick so I have no idea how people actually eat the thing on a bun.  Anyway it was excellent as well as good sized.  I would order it again but I keep reading about how the Fleming's prime burger is very good not to mention a 3rd of the cost of the sliced filet burger.  I will probably try that next time.

My wife ordered the portebello mushroom burger and it was awesome.  It was topped with sauteed spinach and goat cheese.  OMG sooo good!  I should order that next time to put on top of a real burger.  It  was actually very good and I could see myself ordering that if I was not in the mood for red meat.

For dessert we all shared the lava cake.  WOW! Sooo good!  You have to order it 20 minutes in advance so you know it is fresh.  It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a bowl of fresh homemade whip cream.  The whole thing was just awesome but that whip cream put it over the edge.

I had one little mishap this year when someone told me a cupcake was vanilla and I had to find out the hard way (after it was in my esophagus) that it had coconut in it. I'm allergic, see... I was fine after some benadryl the Valley Ho staff had on hand, but it kinda sucked. If you're allergic to things, be sure to ask if what you are about to eat contains those things.

Many vendors ran out of cupcakes this year, but part of that had to do with people taking more than they intended to eat early on. They'll sort it out for next year for sure. Mind Over Batter was my favorite this year. Newcomers Butter and Me and Bre's Petites were also standouts.

Possibly it's the sports memorabilia on the walls. What sets Boston's apart from the rest of the sports bars I've been to is, well, the comfortable feeling I get when I'm there. I'm allowed to drink my mammoth Oktoberfest Sam Adams and stare at the huge TV broadcasting the first game of the World Series - and I can do both without worrying about getting interrupted by rowdy patrons. The only noise I heard was clapping and cheering for the Red Sox. I'm down with that. 

My Boston experience was a first for me. I met a fellow Yelper out to catch the first part of Game One of the World Series. I was only nervous about the game - would the bar play it with sound? Yes! All my worrying was for naught, for they had the game on nearly all their TVs, minus a few that broad casted some NBA and NFL games. Didn't matter to me, as long as the World Series game was on with sound. 

I was asked what I wanted to drink. I wanted Sam Adams. Had to have Sam Adams. Perfect, they had Oktoberfest. I ordered a tall. Never mind the pint. I knew I was going to be there a while. What I didn't know what that ""tall"" meant ""tall and fat."" This beer was HUGE. We're talking mammoth huge! ""Holy $h|t!"" I said when he plopped the delicious beer on my table. No way I was going to be able to drink that without food and drive home after the game. So, about 1/2 way into the mammoth beer, I ordered the Chicken Da Vinci pizza. Yum! 

When I finished off my huge beer, I ordered a pint of the same thing. Oh, why not? I felt comfortable at Boston's, so even when my new friend left, I was content to stay put for a while longer... especially to see the Red Sox spank the Rockies. 

Our server was friendly and attentive. He made sure our drinks were filled and our bellies were full. Plus, he wasn't in any rush to shoo me away from the game. He even made sure I had plenty of water to balance my consumption of beer. Ain't that sweet? 

When I staggered to the bathroom after my mammoth beer, I was amused to find the handles to the ""Hers"" to be a baseball bat. Simply perfect, yep.

I'd always wanted to try the product, yet couldn't justify spending $24 on 16 oz. of bath salts (the price has since increased to $30).  The jar was part of a gift package, but Aveda really doesn't offer discounts on its products.  However, I do appreciate that I'm able to customize gift assortments to include specific products I know the person I'm gifting is particular fond of!  [If you''re ever stumped on what to get someone for the holidays, a birthday, or any other special occasion, try your luck at any Aveda location-- all the women I know love Aveda products (some say they don't, but secretly do and just hate having to pay premium prices for them!).  You say ""But what if the person I'm gifting is a guy?""  Well, I'm going to let you in on a secret-- guys LOVE Aveda-pampering, too!  I know, bec. I've bought hair products, mint soaps, and after shaves from here, and even the most-macho guys grin from ear-to-ear when they find themselves the lucky recipients!  LOL]

Anyhoo, back to that jar of soothing salts I was talking about... I've been rationing my usage of the salts for special occasions, such as when I run out of detoxifying generic Epsom salts*, or when my stash of Aura Cacia Pure Aromatherapy Foam Bath sampler pack doesn't particularly appeal to me at the time.  I am saddened to think that after tonight's wonderful bath, I only have enough for one more blissful soak :(  I know where I could get a brand-new jar for future baths, but some things in life are just more satisfying when they're gifted, don't you agree?  Hmm... Valentine's Day is just around the corner...

I wish I could give this particular location 5 stars, but based on the last few visits (once or twice a year), I really can't, as the prior excellent level of customer service I'd received has considerably depreciated.  Gone are the enthusiastic, yet warm greetings, and rarely, if at all, am I greeted w/ a hot cup of licorice-mint tea, anymore.  But I still love the products, even though I almost-always now get them at Tempe's Moodswings salon...

*Helpful tip:  Epsom salt baths are great after getting massages; a soak helps to significantly mitigate soreness you may sometimes experience after an intense session by reducing inflammation.  I know, bec. I used to say ""OK/alright"" when my ex-therapist would suggest a soak until I finally did one day, and wouldn't you know it, it really did help!  I now almost never go w/out a soak after a session, even if hours may go by before I get the chance!)",review,7IfZTV9Bk8nKfpCrk_rT2w

It's because my girlfriend is a big fan, and every time I walk into this store I'm blown away by just how awesome the customer service is. 

Every Employee at Cost Plus appears to be legitimately happy with their position. All of them stop what they're doing the instant they see a customer near them, ask if you need help, and maybe point something out. Normally, this annoys me because it's a store policy and feels forced. But for some reason it works well here. And when I was looking at a wooden giraffe statue to buy my girlfriend as a gift (we had seen it on a previous visit and thought it was cool), out of nowhere one of the guys told me about how it's hand carved, and that there's some in bigger and smaller sizes, etc. Then, as I carried it back to my car, another employee whom I had talked to in the store, was coming back from his break.

It sucks that I have to drive all the way down to Chandler just to drink some (unless there's one that's open at the Chinese Cultural Center that I don't know about -- * note to self *). 

I've been a big fan of boba for ages - going out of my way cross-town in San Francisco to my favorite joint in the inner Richmond District, getting a custard, Thai iced tea, watermelon or red bean slush packed to the gills with tapioca pearls. Moving to a city (Phoenix) where the population isn't at least 40% Asian means boba is just a tad more scarce. 

Boba Tea House has a giant drink menu - several different kinds of milk teas, slushes, juices, and snows that you can have with or without the boba. But if you don't want boba, why even bother coming here? 

Since my tolerance to things dairy took a nosedive a few years back, I've been limited to what I can have when I'm jonesing for this stuff. And since slushes are basically juices and/or flavors blended with ice, I stick to this column on the menu. Which is all good, because this joint makes a great, refreshing watermelon slush as well as a tasty chocolate mint one. Word to the wise, though - sometimes the slush gets stuck in the straw, and if you inhale a little too strongly you might find yourself choking on a couple tapioca balls.

Therefore, do not attempt this while driving, or you will have the Mesa cops on your ass in no time.

Can you please get your crap together and win some games (similar to last night) so Phoenicians will like you and you can finally build a fan base?  

While I half-enjoyed watching you spank the St. Louis Rams yesterday in the last game of the season, while scoring the most points in a Cardinals game since the 1970s, you still suffer from mediocrity.  Your win against the lowly Rams was hardly inspiring since that team completely sucks. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, can you please beat the piece-of-crap 49ers?!?!

You remind me of a nouveau riche socialite with no manners.  You have a beautiful expensive abode, but still seem like you're from the wrong side of the tracks.  Please tell your owners to stop being so cheap, beef up your roster, spend a little dough and take some risks and the ever-elusive glory years might be around the corner.

Last night, a jaded and cynical fan of yours told my friends (in Rams jerseys) in the parking lot, ""Thanks for sucking today.  WE usually suck and all, but your team was much worse.""

Funny and defeatist attitude, but what do you expect?  I'll be here waiting, cheering and hoping.  There's always next season.

Major issues:  

1.  Noise.  This is the loudest grooming facility I've ever seen.  I don't know how the employees put up with it.  Perhaps it is the narrow structure of the rented space itself.

2.  Communication issues - my pet will be ready when?  I show up at the specified time, and not ready.  I'm told I will be called.  I wait, and wait, and wait.... and finally call back to find out that my pet has been ready for quite some time and they're wondering why I didn't pick him up sooner since I was so impatient.

3.  Some staff don't have a full deck.  I should be cautious here, because maybe she has a disability, but the person who seems to always take my pet and money isn't ""with it"".  Someone spaced out isn't exactly the sort of person you want handling your pet.",review,8pbODP1ngIl3ePfpv0FGDw

DJ Hart Break spins pretty much anything you ask him to, but he does a great job spinning for a lively setting, such as a large scale party or a bar scene.

Friday night - no food in the house - I throw around ideas of places to go, Jared nixes them... this is how the evening started.

Mona was our waitress... and she suggested we share the #16 (Meat Combination) and #17 (Vegetable Combination) to give us a variety of dishes.  That would've been plenty, but I also wanted to try the #10 (Shiro Wat / Ground Peas), so we had that too... oh and since Jared was starving, he ordered a Shorba (Lentil Soup) to start.  

The soup was just ok, but the food was delicious!  We loved the injera (Ethiopian Bread).  and used it to eat the variety of dishes served on a big platter.  Our favorites were the Gomen (collard greens), Fosolia (string beans and carrots), and Key Sega Wat (spicy beef stew), but literally everything was good... we were stuffed after almost cleaning the platter!

I have some friends that have more adventurous palates (ahem, Colleen C), so I look forward to sharing more Ethiopian meals with them at Lalibela in the future!

But, will Frank Sinatra haunt my dreams if I admit I'm not a huge Dirty Martini fan? I thought about it, but I just couldn't make myself pull the martini trigger. Next time, Frank...just for you, I promise! I did have a nice glass of wine though and after a taste of a Belvedere pim's cup, I also learned that Durant's knows how to pour one stiff drink! 

After the cocktails, the evening of cuisine began with the most buttery and garlicky loaf of bread staring us in the face. It's worth every garlic breath bite -- as long as everyone at your table consumes it too. For the entree, I had the wedge salad and the scallops. The salad was creamy and delicious and I like to pretend it was fat free (most definitely not). My meal came with not one, not two but six scallops. I wasn't expecting such generous portions!

I rarely give 5 stars on first visit and this was pretty darn close...by PHX standards this is easily 5 stars!

Fate delivered an article in a local food Blog, It was touted as being like Rudy's as a result I took that as a challenge. Via Yelp I bookmarked it to try.  
The locations is clean and casual. Just enough booths and tables and a small outside patio. The employees and the owner/manager were very friendly and helpful. He gave me a sample of their brisket. While not as smoked as I like was super tender and delicious. I decided on their Yelp Check In special (which is also a regular daily special) of 1/3# Brisket, side, bread and drink for $7.99. Here you buy the items a la carte and the meat by the pound. Like Rudy's there are no plates as they serve and you eat on Butcher paper. For my side I choose Creamed Corn...he gave me a sample first and dare I say this was better than Rudy's. 

 What I love that other places lack is the little bar with sliced onions, dill pickle slices and pickled whole jalapeños. The bread offered is your simple sliced loaf bread, his is traditional and typical of Texas style BBQ joints. You put a little meat onions, pickle and sauce o keep a slice of bread fold in half/eat taco style and enjoy.
The sauce is a hint sweeter than I like, but the smoked flavor was what I enjoyed most. 
I didn't see smoked baked potatoes on the menu, nor did I see the cobblers that Rudy's carries but that may come later. They do have have pecan pie, banana pudding to satisfy your sweet tooth. I already am planning my next trip so I can try more items on the menu.  They also have a nice small selection of bottled beer. What's BBQ without beer or fresh brewed sweet tea which they have as well.
I was too full to dig into my homemade banana pudding. 

Rudy's...you've found your match and I have found my go to BBQ in the valley.

Apparently they've gone over to the dark side. The last few times I've encountered lots of folks there looking to meet folks for the first time (Can you say internet hook up?) and a lot of teenagers who, like Jake was back in the day, are escaping from their parents supervision.

The stuff I've always gotten is hard to screw up so it's hard to speak much for quality - but you can tell it's not exactly served with love.  

Still - it's an awesome location to meet up.  There are lots of good tables inside - though it can get a bit noisy.

1. the waitresses all moonlight as strippers. ha ha, i doubt it, but they are all unbelievably cute and young. they're also all very sweet, if the service was bad (every once in awhile it happens when you've been somewhere so  many times) it seems it was a kitchen issue and the waitress is quick to apologize. 

2. this one is so bad... this is the Chompie's vs. Harlow's theory: as you may realize or heard, this is the place for Tempe locals to hit up after a long night of partying, if you frequent Palo, Casey's, Time Out, etc., you will most likely see any and all of the same cats at Harlow's the next day. that being said, I've heard several guys say, if you're none too proud of who you 'went home with,' you take them to Chompie's instead of Harlow's, since you're less likely to see your friends there. i feel like a jerk just repeating it, but it's not my theory!

anyway, they have tons of plates to choose from and they're all named after 50s-70s movie and tv films or actors. there's the cisco kid, the chill will, the gene special, you get the idea. it's none too pretty to look at, but warm and bustling til they close at 2 p.m. you most likely will have to wait at least 5 to 10 minutes for a table.

i find the food to be a little overpriced for what it is, it seems a greasy spoon like this should be $5 average per plate, but it's more like an $8 average plus coffee or juice. everyone swears by the Eggs Maximilian, a giant tortilla laid flat with eggs, chorizo (optional) green chilies, hot sauce, sour cream and potatoes piled on top. it's HUGE. and, to be honest, I'm a connoisseur of Mexican food, I'd like to think, and for a place like this, their refried beans and tortillas are pretty good ( i get the basic eggs and hashbrowns with a side of tortillas and beans and it's soooo good!)

Fair? Fair. 

However, since I happened to be in the area and it happened to be suggested we grab a sugary bite to eat, I can honestly say (given the aforementioned disclaimer) this place is oh so good. 

From what I can tell, there's nothing that sets this little shop apart from the hoards of other gelato shops in the Valley. I figure the same creamy principles apply. Small spoons. Small cups. Gobs of samples. Pretty decent selection. People behind the counter ready to hand you tiny spoons full of samples, not to mention scoop your selections into tiny cups for savoring. So there. It's probably Generic Gelato, but I loved it nonetheless.

So, I'm not sure why I'm so defensive after giving this place 5 stars. They're probably smart cookies for setting up shop here, inside The District of Tempe Marketplace, where all that shopping sure makes you want a sugary pick-me-up.

LOVE their brunch!  We have been going to their brunches for years.  Groups from 4 to 12 of us have made the trip and it's always a favorite.  Last year my friend told me that when she called she was told they had stopped going brunches, but I actually overheard someone talking about going there for Easter. Lo and behold they are back on!  I talked with a girl there and she said it must have been a miscommunication as they always shut down during the off season (summer) and the length of time each year may be a bit different, but they are totally open for business right now.  

Brunch is $32, or $34 if you include champagne, and really, why wouldn't you?  Service has never been anything but positively outstanding.  But the food is what really puts it over the top.  SO much food and so many great options.  More than you'll get at the Compass room, and at least as much as you'll get at Wrigley Mansion - but for half the price.

The O'Keefe sandwich is my type of sandwich. Grilled chicken breast, sauteed mushrooms, swiss cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, honey mustard on a baguette.  Delicious sounding combination eh? The execution, though, leaves something to be desired.  There was hardly any chicken. In fact I found the whole sandwich to be on the light side.  Everything seemed a bit sparse inside the baguette.  The bread was ok.  I've heard the Symphony and Encore are pretty good too.

The chocolate chip cookie that comes with the sandwich is bonus, but one time I got exactly one chocolate chip in the cookie.  WTF? The side salads are tasty, and for me is the saving grace.   The oriental (isn't Asian, the right term?) noodle salad is my favorite.  Subtle hints of soy and ginger and with sesame seeds. Mmmm.

I can say I appreciate that they don't try to do their own gouging, price-wise. We had a one-hour wait at Bianco's, and as I walked over with my friend, I said, let's check this place out, but if every drink on the menu is $10 we'll just go across the street to Rose and Crown. 
Thankfully, draft beers were about $5 and they had a good selection of local brews (Four Peaks) and imports (Stella). The wine selection had plenty of bottles but only a few options by the glass. They had apps too, that ranged from $5 to $15. We ordered the Goat Cheese Crostini ($5), which ended up being a rather small piece of toast but with a handful of black and green olives on the plate too. We split it between four girls and it was just enough to give us a taste without ruining our appetite for the delicious pizza to come. Though no silverware or plates came out with the app -- so we each had to really man-handle that piece to break off a bite. We all know each other quite well but would sure have been awkward on a date or with acquaintances.

a. A tasty pie NY style. The closest I've found in the valley have been Grimaldi's and Mama Mia. Thin crust, minimal toppings, yum. 
b. A ""regular"" pizza with lots of toppings. I've been accused of having a salad bar on my pizza. This gets expensive so the offer advertised on the banner was promising. 

So I dropped in and ordered one to go with 3 toppings. Not bad. Medium body crust, mild sauce, not too tart or sweet. Plentiful toppings, cheese nicely browned. Tasty.

I was there the very first day they were open and have been back three or four times since.  I waited to write my review until they had their ""grand opening"" and until they had gotten into the groove of having a market.

Boy, where do I start with the complaints?  The biggest complaint is not so much the hours but the DAYS that they are open.  Maybe I'm weird but I do my grocery shopping on Sunday.  We specifically didn't get a few things from F&E because we wanted the ones from the market.  I try and go Sunday but they are closed.  Try and go back Monday...they are closed.  At this point, I really need those items and I'm just going to buy them from a normal store.  It doesn't make any sense why you would have a ton of vendors there on Saturday dropping off their goods only to have them sit, locked up, until Tuesday.  If you need two days off, take Saturday and Wednesday off when the outdoor market is in full swing.

My next complaint is the selection.  I'm not even going to complain that you don't have basic things like fruit or butter.  I'm going to complain that you carry fish from Alaska (not local) and that you carry Shamrock milk! WTF! You could be carrying SuperFarm milk, butter, and ice cream but instead you carry the same thing Target has.  Try supporting real local business instead of mega-giant Shamrock Farms.

Finally, what's with the ""wine bar""?  Is it actually somewhere in the building or am I supposed to sit in the middle of the produce and drink?  It really feels like too much room was wasted on the sandwich/wine bar counter area and not enough was set aside for actual groceries.

The floors could be shinier, the bathrooms could be cleaner, but then it wouldn't be an authentic dive bar would it?

Duke's is a solid choice when looking for a place to play some bar games, watch sports and enjoy some drinks. It's spacious and great for large groups. You name the game, they've got it: several pool tables, darts, shuffle board, Foosball, etc. TVs line the walls with your favorite sport teams playing. With the reasonably priced drinks, this is a good place to pregame before a sporting event or set up shop and watch it on TV. 

I've hosted a party at Dukes and it's a perfect location because of the size, TVs, games and most importantly, because they don't charge to rent out the party room. So, you can have up to 100 people in a party room without any fees! And, for a girl on a budget trying to throw a low key party, this was a perfect choice.

Red Roll
Premium Spicy Tuna Roll
the Lamb
Bacon wrapped Scallops

I am not big into lamb, but this lamb is amazing!  It is prepared over a charcoal fire called sumibiyaki.  You can also smell it burning in the parking lot and the smell alone is enough to drive you nuts.  I did not know what sumibiyaki was prior to visiting Yasu.  It is grilled food prepared over high end Japanese charcoal called binchotan. (Who knew?!)  There is a whole menu prepared this way and I think everyone needs to try it.  

The Premium Spicy Tuna Roll is like no other I have ever had before.  I dream of the heat and texture that just melts in your mouth, making you wish there were more than 5 pieces.  The glory of sushi is you can always just order more and nobody thinks you are a piggy... it's expected.

I'd dined at Chakra 4 Vegetarian Restaurant once before and had a lovely experience... it's not my typical meal as everything there is vegetarian or vegan, but it's healthy and almost like a unique escape from my usual rotation of restaurants.  So, when I decided to search for Red Raspberry leaf tea, this place came to mind, and they delivered!

Jared joined me for lunch here, and I was pleasantly surprised that he really liked it... Maggie was our server and couldn't have been sweeter.  Jared started with an iced chai tea and ordered a wrap / soup combo for his meal.  I went with the Red Raspberry leaf tea and had ""Chef Justin's Special Raw Living Raw Living Garden Burger"" for my meal.  (See pic of menu description).  

The food here is pricey but I guarantee you will feel super healthy no matter what you order!  We opted out of dessert both visits, but there were plenty of delicious looking options to choose from, so save room if you'd like to end your meal with something sweet.

After missing my exit (brain was on ""auto-drive,"" and my hands steered the car on its usual path heading home), I had a little trouble finding the parking lot due to being unaccustomed to the city's roads and their one-way signs, but once I found the site, it was smooth sailing.  Was able to save a few bucks over long-term airport parking.  I actually stumbled onto FastTrack while purchasing airplane tickets online.  Before I clicked ""purchase"" for parking, I thought to check directly w/ FT's website, and voila!, I found it cheaper to bypass Orbitz' link!  (FYI: you may choose covered or uncovered parking-- the former will, of course, cost more.)

We had two different shuttle drivers, and while the first was friendly enough, the second one actually de-boarded the shuttle to take our roll-ons onto the bus AND did the same when we alighted at the parking lot.  Yes, he didn't just take our bags out of the bus and place them at our feet, but actually took the roll-ons and placed them IN MY CAR!  Talk about great service!  Accordingly, I tipped him more than I did the other guy.

Shuttles arrive at the airport to pick you up and take you to the parking lot at regular intervals, but you can always call the dispatcher using the number on the card the driver provides to make sure a driver is on his/her way.

The restaurant - described as cozy - features noodle dishes from Japan, China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. Also, there's live jazz music Friday and Saturday nights. 

So, ask yourself: Would that tempt you? It certainly did me, and at 7 p.m. on a Saturday, my sushi-lovin' friend and I met here. 

We were immediately shown to a corner booth and given menus. Our server was friendly, albeit a tad eccentric, which we didn't mind. Her quick, matter-of-fact manner was something we couldn't decide if we liked. But, that's okay. 

Our first challenge was to pick out our drinks. The wine list is HUGE. There's also specials they write on a big chalk board. Narrowing it down to a few selections took a few minutes... and my friend was disappointed to be told twice that they were out of the drink of her choice (including one of the sakes on the menu). Bummer. I went with the J Lohr Wildflower red blend. And I didn't like it. I told our server that I should have taken her suggestion and gotten the Writer's Block Zin and I was hoping I could send back the Wildflower. 

""You don't like it?""
""No, sorry. I don't.""
""That's okay. I hate it. It's so popular, though. I don't understand why.""

Uhm, good to know. For being honest about other wines, she certainly held her tongue when I placed my order. 

My friend and I split the Salmon Salad app, with fresh spinach and pine nuts. It was very tasty. The Salmon was tempura, but I didn't find it too fried to enjoy. 

We then shared the Best of Asia - 3 pieces each of yellow tail, tuna and salmon, lightly seared and flavored with garlic, paprika, ponzu and a jalapeno on top. HOT! I had two pieces and left the rest for my friend. 

The Big Buddha Roll, which we shared, was very, very tasty. It was a little spicy, but in that good way I enjoy. This roll was double wrapped with soy paper on the outside and had crab meat, avocado, cream cheese and salmon inside. YUM! 

About 3/4 of our way through dinner, the server brought out my new glass of wine. Uhm, ok. 

""Sorry, I totally forget.""
""But at least you remember,"" my friend remarked. 

As for the atmosphere, it can only be summed up this way: Airport. 

I got the feeling that if I walked out the front doors, I'd be inside an airport terminal, headed to whatever gate I needed to be at to make my flight. The interior of the place, like my friend pointed out, seemed to be the type of place that ""you cram things inside a space that don't really fit or belong."" Bingo! 

The sushi bar/kitchen takes up the bulk of the space, with a short sushi bar area to its immediate side. There's a few tables scattered about, as well as a few booths. The decor is red, black and white - Get Out was right about that. I just would never call this place cozy. They did turn down the lighting around 7:30 which helped immensely. 

As for the music, it was nice jazz. The trio set up in a corner and played a few songs. Sax, drums, guitar - what else do you need? On our way out, while the band was on break, we learned they weren't even a band... and that they just kind of set up and played in an impromptu style. Regardless, they were enjoyable. They didn't really fit the motif of the restaurant, tho. It was more of the ""airport restaurant trying to be a cool lounge with live music.""

When the bill came, I was pleased to see our server did not charge me for the glass of wine I sent back. I appreciated that. 

Yet, the bill was a bit too high for the type of service/experience my friend and I had here at Asia. $46 for 2 people? Ouch. Both the Buddha Roll and Best of Asia were $12 a piece (the former totally worth it; the latter not). The appetizer salad was $8. My friend's sake was $2 (bargain) and my glass of really great Zin (a new fave) was $9. All in all, it added up. But I definitely would not go back to throw down that kind of money at a place that reminded me of an airport restaurant. 

Also, while we were waiting for the server to run my card, I flicked with my forefinger what I thought was a piece of paper, though in my mind it looked like a tiny, tiny fly. Turns out the ""piece of paper"" sprouted legs and started to crawl across the table. IT WAS A BUG! Ew. Gross. 

This place has potential, but it'll need a real overhaul to entice me to come back.

They were hosting an open house and invited the public in their doors for a sneak peak of the spa within. From the moment I entered the doors and took a journey through this Moroccan inspired spa, I was hooked and have been back several times over the years. 

The ambiance at Joya Spa is practically royal. From the minute I walk down the path of water fountains into the doors of a large rounded entrance, I feel like I'm royalty. A large rounded staircase with a banister rims part the room, while a gift shop and salon rim the rest. 

The gift shop has everything from trendy dresses (both for day and night), flip flops, jewelery, spa products and sunglasses. This is a great find for gifts and any items to complete my outfit if I was staying here for the weekend. 

Next, I will touch upon the salon. I've had a mani and pedi here and both were top of the line without being too over the top expensive. The pedicure chairs are a professional massage in itself and the staff does a wonderful job on both the pedicure and manicure. Everything is very clean, smells fresh and I leave with happy hands and feet. 

Up the staircase, is the rest of the spa including services like facials, massages, couples massages, a steam room, locker room, workout room and most importantly a rooftop pool overlooking Camelback Mountain. This is definitely one of the best views in the Valley. The massage rooms are gorgeous and some of them are practically like hotel room in itself. They have a bathroom, sitting area and even open up to the rooftop pool. Like I said, they offer couples massages and regular ones. I've had a regular one and it's pure ""joya."" Their locker rooms are spacious and kept very nice and clean. 

I love this spa because I can truly make an entire day of it, which is what I opt for when I have a spa day.

It's a really cute and small place.  Very cozy and inviting.  We were sat at the hightop, which essentially turned it into a communal table as another couple was already sitting there.  I am a big fan of communal seating, it's such a fun concept that Phoenix should embrace more.

I got the Roasted Vegetable and Shrimp Pesto.  The pasta was very nicely cooked and the sauce was really tasty but extremely runny.  I kept flinging sauce everywhere.  The veggies were obviously seasonal, but I picked through most of them, sticking with the asparagus and yummy mushrooms.  The shrimp were also very good, being plump and wonderfully cooked.  The bread that came with it was excellent for sopping up the extra sauce.

The husband got the inside out Pizza Burger.  He wasn't too pleased with it, but thought that a better way of putting the ingredients together would make it taste great.

After dinner we decided to order their half baked cookie.  The husband and i both have a weakness for these.  About 2 minutes after we ordered it, the cookie was delivered to our table... burnt.  We tried to eat it, but it was too much.  The owner came by along with our waiter and they very quickly remedied the situation, no questions asked.

Our service was pretty good considering our poor waiter had busted up his knee earlier, but my refills of soda were plentiful.  He also immediately fixed our issue with dessert which is also a big plus with me.  Very chatty guy.

As a side note, we visited Maizie's again on their 3 dollar burger day.  You get a 3 dollar burger.  It was overdone even though I ordered it medium.  I will stick with a big, fat, juicy whopper for 3 bucks instead.  Maybe it was just a bad day.

For delivery I quickly learned to stay away from anything with a dough component, from egg rolls to pizza it was always Luke warm and soggy by time I sunk my teeth in to it.

It is a basic Italian linguine covered in a garlicky, peanut sauce, there are is some bean sprouts and carrots in the mix.

I have also tried the salmon when I was trying to be healthy, however it was clear that their blacking process involved a good amount of butter.

As for the pizzas there is a eclectic mix of pizzas topped with items not traditionally seen on pizza, at least until the California pizza scene had effected out world.  I opt for the mushroom pizza. It is a sourceless style pizza with a ""mushroom pesto"" that is quite earthy and greasy.

But let me be absolutely clear: going to Hanny's is most definitely a 1-star experience, for reasons I will describe below. When I write a one-star review on Yelp, it means the following: I will not come here again unless I really have to (e.g., some pre-planned organizational event beyond my control). I will refuse to recommend anyone that I know to come here. I will refuse to suggest this as a venue for any event for any of the organizations I belong to. And I will tell everyone that I know, whenever it comes up, that Hanny's is a horrible place to spend any part of your evening. 

Seated at a large table with about 10 or 15 people one recent night, a friend and I ordered a beer each. Everyone else ordered various drinks and some snacks, and a pizza or two, as well. After 5 or 10 minutes, everyone else had gotten our drinks but the two of us. Though this is a bit annoying, it's nothing to write home about and not a big deal. Another 5 minutes later, the pizzas came out, which we weren't eating. 

But, still no beers. 

Another 5 minutes later (about 20 minutes after we'd ordered them), a third friend of ours who had noticed our beer-less selves got irritated on our behalf and decided to complain to our waiter. Yes, she did so in a somewhat stern manner. But she was not rude, and she did not speak with a raised voice. She was just to-the-point, and spoke in a manner that was commensurate with the unacceptably slow service we were being provided.

A waiter who receives a complaint like this has a choice in how to respond. I dare say that the professional response, especially when (as is the case here) the customer actually IS right and the service actually HAS been unacceptably slow, is to say, ""Ma'am, you're right, and I am so sorry. We've just been backed up and I will bring them out pronto."" That would be the end of the story, right?

Alternatively, you could stare back at the customer with a hostile look, and then defiantly declare with a rude and aggressive tone of voice, ""Yeah, I'll get them, but as you can see we had a lot of food to bring out."" Which is what happened. So, Excuse me? Our friend looked back and returned the favor, ""I don't really care what your logistical problems are. I'm just pointing out that they don't have their drinks and they've been waiting for 20 minutes."" The response: ""Yeah, I heard you the first time."" He then sulked off. 

That wasn't the end of it. Playing some sort of passive-aggressive game with the two of us, this waiter deliberately made us sit for an additional 5 or 10 minutes before finally bringing out our beers. He then refused to come back to our table again, even when new people joined our party and wanted to order a drink. (We wound up advising them to go directly to the bar to order, since we were being actively boycotted.) When he finally did bring us our drinks, I waited to see if an apology would accompany (keep in mind that the two of us had actually remained silent while all this was going on, since our other friend had decided to take on the service problem.) I was completely stunned to hear a wall of silence. I had done or said nothing to this man at all, other than politely order a glass of beer from him 25 minutes earlier. He could not muster up a simple, ""Sorry about that, guys."" 

Did I mention that this wasn't a busy night, so we were one of only a few groups they had to service at the time? 

As our table talked about what just happened, I learned that others have experienced this behavior from the staff in the past. And it actually has been to this level of deep and open hostility by waiters (I assume the same one). This doesn't shock me. There is no way a waiter or manager would become so emboldened to behave this way in front of customers he doesn't even know, unless it's part of a pattern. This wasn't just ""having a bad night,"" which I let go all the time when I occasionally encounter it in restaurants. It was something deeper than that. 

Not only does the rudeness appall me, but so does the sheer incompetence of not realizing how widespread word-of-mouth can be when you attack a group of customers like us. How does this waiter know who we are? Maybe some of us are long-time residents of downtown Phoenix, who have lived there for years and know a lot of people? Maybe our voices, here on Yelp and among our very large social circles, are highly influential and can have a direct impact on a restaurant's revenues? Did he consider that before deciding to attack us? Nope.

Karl Kopp, the owner of Hanny's, needs to have a serious talk with whoever is managing this restaurant. In the meantime, my opinion that I will loudly and frequently proclaim to everyone I know will remain unchanged, unless and until I receive a personal apology for this incident.

So as the weather approached 80, I knew the time had come to book it immediately.  

I arrived bright and early in the morning to be greeted by the friendly staff, a great scent lingering throughout the building and a beautiful pool staring at me from below. After a speedy check-in process, they gave me my itinerary and sent me to the woman's locker room. Upon entering, I was greeted by some more friendly staff who gave me a locker room key and took me on a tour. The locker room is complete with razors, lotion, shampoo, conditioner, mouth wash, hair spray, deodorant, full private showers, a jacuzzi, steam room and two private lounges...and the day is only just beginning! 

Throughout the day, I had a facial, Swedish massage, manicure and blow-out. I scheduled them sporadically so that I was able to enjoy several hours by the pool that overlooks a gorgeous view of Camelback Inn. While lounging by the pool, I munched on a light lunch of a veggie wrap from Sprouts Cafe, the restaurant at the spa. The food was delicious and they list the nutrition next to each item so you have an idea of your intake. Following several hours at the pool, I decided to check out the gym and feel a little productive during the blissful day by working out. The gym is state of the art and each treadmill has a private tv. The staff is constantly cleaning and wiping off the equipment. So now let's go back to the most important part: the services. Each service was spectacular! The facial was relaxing and hydrating and even included a prolonged neck and shoulder massage. The Swedish massage was so heavenly it put me to sleep...in a good way. The blow-out left me feeling like a celebrity (and included a scalp massage) and the manicure made my nails weekend-ready (and included a hand massage).

When I first got there, there was hardly anyone at the resturant, and it seemed like we got loads of attention from our server.  She was always coming over to us to bug us to order something.  I honestly wasn't that hungry, but I felt like I should order something, since the waitress kept coming over.   I ordered the American hot dog plate, and got fries and my coke to go with it.  

Eventually every one else ordered, but one girls sliders order completely got ignored and never delivered.  When she mentioned something to the server, she seemed as surprised as we were.  It seems like after I food got delivered, that's when things went downhill.  For starters, the place got packed with people watching the USA/Canada hockey game, but I feel like maybe we got forgotten.  So much so, that I had to ask a manager to get our bill for us.  I also told him that we haven't seen or heard from our server in almost an hour.  then, when the bill DID finally come, we had to send it back to get split so we could all play our share.

I know its a sports bar, but it really lacked in service.  I think our table really felt ignored after while, with no drink refills, and having to flag down servers to even get our bill.

The best part of the meal for me was the Grapefruit & Hamachi dish.  It was amazing!  I am a big fan of sashimi and I also love grapefruit but I wasn't sure how the combination of the two would be.  Turns out it was perfect.  I was saying to my husband on the way home that this was probably the best sushi that I have ever had but then I remembered one fantastic meal at Nobu in Las Vegas.  So, I think we may have a tie there.  Which is interesting since the chefs have similar first names (Nobuo Fukuda vs. Nobu Matsuhisa).

I actually started the meal with another surprising combo.  The watermelon and goat cheese salad had a very different but overall pleasing taste to it.  The tangy creaminess of the goat cheese was a good contrast to the crisp fruity sweetness of the watermelon.  It also went really well with the cocktail I had ordered... the Cucumber Shiso.  This drink was not as good as it sounded but it was ok.  Though I may have been overly critical after enjoying the mind-blowing drinks at Citizen Public House a couple of nights before.  I did also try the White Dragon Jasmine cocktail and that was one was better.  But still not worth the $14 price tag (the menu said $11 so I'm not sure if that was a mistake or what).  Next time I will get the hibiscus iced tea that Lucia ordered since that looked lovely.  I also had some of the Pork Belly Buns as recommended by everyone and they did not disappoint.  And to finish the meal, the chocolate mousse.  That was a really awesome dessert.  I could not taste the tofu at all but I think that was the source of the ultra silky smooth texture of the mousse.

A friend from work and I were bar hopping all over downtown and riding bicycles. We had already been to Carly's, Lucky Strike, Roosevelt, Bikini, Paisley Violin, and Lost Leaf. It was a perfectly fine drunken evening. Riding by District, I said hi to three women smoking on the patio. They said hi back, and I thought that was it. 1/2 block later, I look back and my friend is not anywhere to be seen. He made convo with the three, and scored one of their numbers. SWEET! Well, an hour of talking to them and he had an open invitation for us to join them for Chris Isakk... I wasn't feeling it though. It's just Chris Isakk, and I can't drive, and the train doesn't go there, and a taxi costs too much.... the only option is to bike! it's almost four miles!! So we biked, and biked, and biked. 

Finally, after the most awkwardly drunken bike ride down roosevelt for several miles, we arrived to a full parking lot and no idea where to go or how to get in. This place has no signage about which entrance is what. I go to lock my bike to a fence and the girl at the door says I cannot do that here. When I asked where I could lock it up, she replied ""sir, I make $5.75 an hour."" Ok, cool, but where can I lock my bike up? She said I could lock it to a light pole, so I started to do that, then she said ""not that light pole sir. I make $5.75 an hour please don't make my job hard."" I don't care how much you make. This wen't on for 10 minutes. Then trying to get into the place was next to impossible. We couldn't get close enough to the door to exchange tickets with our contact, and she couldn't go out the door because they have a no-reentry policy. Eventually some young girl with authority told us it was our lucky day and we could both go in for free... YESSSSSS! My sweet brunette savior. 

Inside the venue, everything goes in a circle, and is very intimate. There really isn't a bad seat in the house. The stage rotates so everyone gets a good view for half the show. They have plenty of concession stands, and $7 a beer is at least better than Chase Field, US Airways Center, or Dodge.

I'm not sure if perhaps its a regional thing but I'm accustomed to something a bit lighter and slightly flaky. There was this other bread that reminded me of Indian Fry Bread (bhature), was so tasty! I would go back just for that alone!

This was another great experience with Helen Y and her amazing taste! Looking forward to going back but not ordering as much now that I know sort of whats what.

When me and the lovely CP entered, we were warmly welcomed by the hostess. This shocked me since most times hostesses are snotty as can be. We were seated in a large, comfortable booth and immediately greeted by our waitress, Angel. 

Angel was also extremely friendly, accommodating, had a really good knowledge of their offerings and provided really great service. 

I was extremely impressed with the prices. We got two meals, two beers and a glass of wine for under $40. 

I really enjoyed the dishes, and they were plated well. We got the yellow curry with tofu (+ tofu at no extra charge is awesome!!) and the Hippy noodles with tofu. Both were extremely flavorful and perfectly spiced.

Not only does it stand out as something different than you'll find anywhere else in Phoenix but it also provides top culinary options that will satisfy most palates.

There are a few gripes about Fez though.  The first is that parking can be a headache when they are busy.  Kinkos takes up most of the good spots.  The second is that Fez is really a gay bar masquerading as a restaurant.  Not that having gay clientele is a problem but the servers will only pay attention to you if you are not a co-ed group.  I get terrible service when I take my wife or we go with other couples.  When I bring a guy friend, we are always immediately tended to.  

The drink selection is good but they don't have a blender so don't expect anything slushy.  The drink menu consists of martinis of all different flavor combination and are quite popular.  The pomegranate one seems to be a favorite of my friends.

The food selection is a bit overwhelming upon reading the menu.  Arugula, pears, saffron; all sorts of strange additions to traditional American plates.  The wife always orders the lamb chops with pesto.  She swears by them.  I always get the Fez Burger.  It is, by far, the best burger in Phoenix.  The bbq sauce's tangy-ness mixed with the sweet pear makes the burger unbelievable.  Unfortunately, the salad that accompanies the Fez Burger is one of the worst combination I have ever been forced to eat.  

Fez is a lounge type environment.  Some of the tables are couches, some are four tops, and some are high tops.  There is usually some techno music playing but it is not too loud to disturb your conversation.  They have a patio that, assuming they still allow this, will let you bring your dogs out with you.

The wings, the burgers, the shuffleboard, the tv's, and well just about everything about the place has been hyped to the point that I was dying to go there when I found out they opened one across the street from my favorite sports bar, Hazelwoods. 

The beginning of our visit didn't start out so well, when we asked for sound on the Suns game and heard the response ""we only do sound for big games or if people request it."" Firstly, it's a big game anytime the home team is playing. Maybe you're new to Phoenix, Mr. Manager of a Sports Bar, but you need to figure out that Phoenix has always been a basketball city. Also, the sound has been requested, we are requesting it, and I was told when I called at 4:30 PM  that sound on the game would be no problem. I told the manager about my previous phone call and he didn't seem to care. 15 minutes later he came by and said ""ok, some people requested sound so we are going to turn it on."" damn, was it that hard?

Food came, and I ordered the golden medium wings I'd heard so much about. Hmm, these wings were neither meaty, crispy, or quality. They sure were tasty, but the quality was not there. I had the Wednesday special of four chicken tacos, and they were also of low quality. I know this is a sports bar and I don't expect tremendous cuisine, but c'mon, don't insult me with this garbage. I'd have been better suited eating chicken mcnuggets from McDonald's. I was in for $40 having three beers, tacos, and wings. I couldn't have been more unimpressed. I've spent half the money at Hazelwoods and Native New Yorker and been twice as happy.

Now this was a kicker that may not be big to anyone but I thought it was pathetic. Their shuffleboard table has bars on it that prohibit anyone from playing unless you put money in it. I've NEVER seen a bar which doesn't allow you to play complimentary or even just hold your keys like Pomeroy's or 16th Street Sports Bar. Ridiculous. Lame. Awful. Also, their TV setup was not what I expected. I don't think there was anything bigger than about 50"" and with how high on the walls they were, they were kind of difficult to see from certain places.

Everything was extremely tasty. We took a trip to the UK last year and that was the first time I had encountered pasties which were viewed there more as street food to eat on the run, like hot dogs are in NY. But I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the menu here since there are so many options! They have every kind of pasty you could want, even tex-mex and Italian style options. I went for the traditional British shepherd's pie and it was amazingly good. My husband got the rosemary steak which I had a bite of and I thought it was also very good, although neither of us liked the sauce it came with. Since it was a chilly night, we started with the soup; he had the potato-leek and I had the mushroom. Both were very good although I could feel my arteries clogging up as I drank mine (think major butter/cream). We also ordered garlic chips (wedge fries with chopped roasted garlic on top) and they were d-lish! As it turned out the pasties were so large we really should not have ordered sides but I forced myself to box up half of mine so that I could save room for desert. I had the Shirley Temple pudding which was this amazing British-style pudding with caramel sauce that made the top and edges a little crispy. It came with the sweet cream to drizzle on top. It was like bread candy. I know that sounds weird but it was seriously good. 

I agree with the other reviewers that the service is extremely slow. We were there for over 2 1/2 hours! But I got the impression it was due to them being short-staffed and the fact that the nature of the food means it takes a while to cook... rather than the servers being rude or snobby. The excellent variety of beers on tap (including Strongbow cider, yay!) means that you can keep yourself entertained in the interim and the food is definitely worth the wait.

2.5 stars.

Came for happy hour, but didn't find anything on the happy hour food menu I wanted to try, so I ordered a medium Emilia Romagna pizza (mozzarella, parmesan, and 12-year balsamic vinegar- Aceto Balsamico).  Can't recall what the price was on this pizza, but it was probably around the $14 range.  The pizza came a bit too charred on the bottom, and the very thin-crust didn't stay crispy for very long, perhaps just 5 minutes, and definitely soggy by the 10-minute mark.  While I enjoyed the slice I had at the restaurant, the leftovers proved to be too salty when I tried to re-heat the pizza at home, so I had to toss the rest- not economical for the price, I'm sorry to say.  I only ate a slice at Fred's, bec. I wanted to try the cobbler-of-the-day, which was the apple cobbler topped w/ Haagen-Daaz ice cream (if I recall correctly).  Had to order it sans powdered sugar (corn allergy), and I found it good, and not too sweet.  I'd try their other cobblers, too, if they didn't come at a high cost ($9, plus the ice cream has corn syrup in it- corn allergy).  I'd also like to try the profiteroles, but they, too, come w/ a $9 tag, which means $4.50 per profiterol- I believe I'd asked how many came in a dish and was quoted two...

Don't be fooled by the scowl that the bouncer-type bartender constantly has on his face-- he actually was nice to talk to, at least the first time I spoke to him.  A couple of friends and I went there after a mixer about a month ago, and he was unapproachable, and projected himself to be too busy to do more than to come over and take our order.  No hellos and how-are-yous that night- such a big turn-off, and w/ a high-priced menu, I don't think I'll come by again.

First visit.  Happy hour.  Two rolls- A Philadelphia and a spicy salmon roll, deep-fried, with roe on top.  Most sushi spots gladly substitute an ingredient if the regular order contains allergens I can't have without an upcharge.  Not Kabuki.  (I've had owners, chefs, and cooks tell me themselves that if a recipe is easily amenable, they'll gladly do the substitutions, w/ no offense taken.  This Kabuki chef isn't one of them.)  So food photos will reflect these recipe omissions.  Ordered a glass of house pinot grigio, which had a big black speck floating in it, but this was quickly remedied.  

So few HH apps and drinks to choose from.  Servers were friendly enough, but sushi chef was VISIBLY annoyed (full face-frontal) when I had to return a dish as it contained an allergen I requested not to be used.  I could understand the offense if I had forgotten to include the info, or if I had multiple orders that made it hard for him to keep track, but a mistake on the second of two dishes, and with a list of allergens on a note right under your nose as a reminder??

* Smashwedge Salad - my wife and I shared this and it was very good.  Very odd though (in a good way) for a fast food place.

* Classic Smashburger - Excellent.  Perfectly juicy and tasty.  Definitely one of the best fast food burgers I've tasted.  You can see and taste that the ingredients were very fresh.

* Smashfries and Sweet Potato Smashfries = No bueno!!!  I was really looking forward to eating these, but I didn't think they were very good at all.  I just do not enjoy rosemary on my fries.  French fries shouldn't taste like soap or something.  I don't know - maybe I'm just not fancy enough to like random herbs on my fries.  At the very least they could have went farther down fancy lane and provided some aioli which would have been nice.  Next time I'm going to hold the flowers and order regular fries for sure.

I know I wasn't paying but I feel this place is overpriced.  An average of $6-$7 for a burger or chicken sandwich seems a bit high.  By the time you add fries and a drink you are over $10 which is way high for a fast food place.

I really wanted to try the veggie frites but they were out so maybe next time I'll give them a whirl.  I may give the fried pickles a shot as well because I am very curious as I had never tried one before.

dr karawi is exactly opposite of that (don't know if he has a house in the caymans though). what really, really, really surprised me was the karawi cleaned my teeth....the Dentist! he does that for all his patients. i asked him why, and he just said he likes to get to know his patients. how novel!

I don't know where they are getting it from, but it's not the Wonder truck.  As Gabi noted, Boar's head meat and cheeses are served.  There are also bagels and breakfast sandwiches, coffee drinks, and hot dogs available.

I thought the food was excellent, but I was really surprised when a half sandwich, a wrap, and two bottles of water were over $17!  Upon further investigation, I discovered my half of a turkey sandwich (and this is truly half of a normal-sized sandwich) was $5.85!  ""Why how much is a whole sandwich?"" you ask.  $6.40!  You save a whopping 55 cents by ordering half.  Now I know there's labor to make the sandwich, but the prices tell me the ingredients are worth $1.10.  While I would happily pay $6.40 for the whole sandwich, the half is grossly overpriced IMO.  Next time, if there is a next time, I'll order the whole one and throw half in the trash so at least I don't leave feeling violated.

Again in one of my indecisive moods, I scanned over the chalkboards to see if anything jumped out. OooooH.....the Market Sampler $9, soup, sandwich, snacks, cheeses, salads. When I asked it was described as a nice variety of many of the items they offer in smaller portions. Sweet! The lady behind the counter let me know that this option would take a little more time to prepare, but I was not in a hurry. Also had her serve me up a glass of a Lemongrass [Agua] Fresca. I took a seat with my Fresca and watch them go to work. 

Sipping my lemongrass fresca I wasn't sure what to expect as I read the ingredient list while waiting....lemongrass, celery, lime juice, sparking water and simple syrup. I was skeptical about the celery flavor in particular. WOW! This was super. Not to sweet and the celery was not over powering and just added to its bright, fresh and invigorating flavor. 

The Sampler was huge. Easily shared , this is a BIG meal for 1, a light meal or nice appetizer for 2. I could see this being kind of like chef ""surprise"" as you really don't which of the sandwiches, soups or cheeses they may put on the board. [I guess you could have more say but I liked letting them just do their thing.] The soup on the board was a chilled spinach cucumber. 
My board had 3 varieties of cheese, a espresso lavender cheddar, a sheep's milk parmigiana type, and some cheese curds with a light dressing. 
There were also 3 salads on the board a cabbage based ""slaw"" with toasted almonds n stuff in a light vinaigrette type dressing (on the spicy side), a roasted potato and veggie salad and a brown rice salad (a little salty). 
There were 4 sandwich portions, 2 were a roasted veggie with a balsamic dressing on rustic Italian type bread and the other 2 were a peanut butter banana with a mango pepper jelly on multigrain. The final treat on the plate was a some corn chips and tomato based/salsa like dip.

If you live in the area, you should really consider making this your store. And here's why...

1. No member cards.
Albertson's started doing member cards a few years ago much to my dismay... I protested and pissed and moaned because I knew what it meant... At the time, they were the last store to not have such a program and I would've gone miles out of my way to shop there for that reason alone. These savings cards are bullshit - first of all, they take personal info from you and use it to market to you and monitor what you buy. It's a privacy issue and a spam issue. Second, these fucking cards cost money - you really think you're saving anything? It costs them millions to launch such a campaign - they have to get that money somewhere. They get it by raising the prices of shit. I noticed it right away as soon as the cards were implimented. Even with the savings card, my groceries were more expensive than before. Fuck that. Anyway, they finally got rid of the cards again - so I love them again. Thank you Albertson's.

2. This place is a den of hot chicks. 
Strippers, college students, hot nurses, and all sorts of sexy singles shop here. I've never seen such a hot group of 20-30somethings shopping for groceries in one place. Now, I shop later at night usually - but it doesn't seem to matter too much what time of day you go. It's a good looking crowd. Single people, take your carts and smash into someone you find attractive and strike up a conversation... ask some cutie if they know the best way to squeeze a melon (even though you thunk em, I think).

3. Selection... 
this place has a decent selection of wine and organic products and produce and deli and whatever else. It's not the best store I've ever been to, but it's good. In fact, that's where that 5th star went - this place could be a little better if it was a little bigger or newer... Still, it's got everything I'm ever looking for which is all you can really ask for from a grocery store. They stopped carrying the bread I like and I had to ask a few times and submit a few cards, but they started carrying it again. So I can't help but like this store. 

4. Prices...
It doesn't have the best prices on everything, but for someone like me who doesn't do coupons, my grocery bill is smaller here than it is at Fry's with their savings card. 

You can also get gas here and their gas isn't that bad. It's also normally pretty cheap. If you live in the area, give this shopping center a try...",review,cSY4B9WBslxhpkJqaQLwJA

So, when my friend told me she wanted a bowling birthday party, I was excited to plan it.  
I was worried that it would be tough to reserve lanes on a Saturday night, but AMF was extremely accommodating.  They allowed me to reserve the 4 lanes we needed in advance with a credit card, no problem.  That way, when the group showed up, our lanes would be together and everyone could pay their own way.  For $5 per game, it was affordable and fun!  We ate before, but I saw several people eating pizza, pretzels, and popcorn from the food stand, and of course, there is a full bar as well!  

We had the lanes from 8 - 10 which worked out perfect.  We brought in a cake and they had no problem with that; they even allowed us to store it in their freezer until we were ready to light the candles, and they supplied us with a knife!

****At 10:00, the bowling alley goes into 'extreme' mode, and it's party time!  The lights dim, the music blares, and big screens come down showing extreme sports while you bowl.  Next time, we'll have to experience that!

Having Rogue's Hazelnut Brown on tap is one of them. Here, at Papago Brewery, they call this beer ""nectar."" I call it ""the beer that started it all."" That is, I was always interested to check out this place, but I was never more sold until I heard they sold Rogue here. REALLY?! Yes, really. 

So, guess what I ordered? Uh-huh. My beer buddy had the Sunshine from New Belgium (also good). Our first server was a nice, curly-haired lad, although he seemed to be sleep-walking. Our second was a friendly tattooed man who reminded us of Dave Navarjo. Having heard I wanted to try one of Papago's own, he brought out four - count them! - four samples for me to try. I went with the Red Ale, for it was the best out of the bunch. Not that the others were lacking. They were all good, but the Red Ale surpassed them all. 

Did I mention there was also a young lady helping us? Yep, so in actuality, we had THREE people at Papago taking care of us. Where else is that gonna happen?

So, my friend and I chatted, enjoyed our beers and gazed lovingly at the refrigerated shelves of beer mecca. You see, here at Papago, you can get some to go. Or, if nothing on tap fancies you, you can select from the stock on shelf and have it right at your table. YOU HEARD ME! This is a wickedly cool idea. 

After my friend and I shared the Beer-B-Que pizza, which uses Hazelnut Brown to make the sauce, I selected some beer to go. The Rogue selection here is great. They even had Monk Madness, which you can't find at BevMo. I snatched that up. I should have gotten Rogue's Red Ale, too. Instead, I took up the $8.50 for 6 12oz bottles of American beer. That's mix-and-match, folks. That's another amazing thing about Papago Brewery. Our server (the DN look-alike) was helpful in suggesting ales for me to try. That was appreciated, for he already sort of had an idea of what I gravitated toward, based on my earlier orders. 

I ended up walking away with a variety 6-pack and large bottle of Monk Madness, which costs only $4.69. Talk about a steal! 

So, yes... Papago Brewery, you sure got my attention! Rogue Beer on tap and for sale. Not to mention they also had Rare Vos and Three Philosophers - two New York beers I haven't seen on sale anywhere else (unless you count The Lost Leaf). DON'T GET ME STARTED on the many others I've seen here that I haven't seen anywhere else... including a Japanese label I am curious to try.

So, while the decor may be lacking and there was no music playing the entire time we were there, I am giving Papago Brewery my seal of approval. 

Let's re-cap (or uncap, if you will) the awesomeness:
*Attentive, fast and knowledgeable service
*Hazelnut Brown on tap!!! 
*Beers by the bottle for sale - to drink in the bar or take home
*An enormous selection of beer available (like Rogue!)
*Good prices and tasty bar food

I will definitely be back!

Tonight I went back for seconds since I had a good experience the first time, and it wasn't as much fun as I remember.

The first time I was here, it was a Saturday night and there was hardly any one in the place.  I came here tonight (Friday) and the place was slightly busier.  I went up to the counter to review the menu, and the girl who took my order answered my questions. I thought I had told her that I was eating there. I swear I did.  She assumed that I was carrying out.  I don't know how that got mixed up, but my first red flag should have been her saying ""you can wait at the bar."" I said ""no, I'm going to sit in the back.""  

So, ordered the Brisket sandwich, and waited in the back.  Other patrons that were there before me all got there food, and eventually my order was ready.  After she delievered the other orders to the table, she looked at me and said ""your foods ready.""  Um, okay, so bring it out like you did the others?

Eventually the other girl walked the bag with my food in it in a to go box with no drink to my table. I told her that I wanted to eat it here, and would like to get a plate. She apologized, and took the bag of food back with her.  At this point, I went up to the counter to get my drink because honestly I was getting kinda thirsty.  As I approached the girl who initially took my order was talking to the guy working behind the counter and taking orders and sort of looked in my direction.

They had like a zillion TVs and a interactive video game thingy at every booth which was very neat.  If there was a Buffalo Wild Wings near my house and I was into sports I would definitely stay there for hours to drink, eat and watch games.

So about the food....

Since it is almost the new year and I want to start it off right, I opted out of the typical wings because they are fried and breaded.  I just don't understand why wing places haven't figured out that they can just bake their wings and they will be just as good?  Anyway,  my wife and I each ordered the Naked Tenders and side salads.  The tenders came with whatever sauces you want so we got 5 to try.  My wife didn't like any of them but my favorite was the parmesan garlic.  The spicy garlic wasn't too bad but anything hotter than that was just too hot for us.  We both thought the tenders were very good and simple.  They are also a very healthy option if you don't dip them in too much sauce so I tried not to.  The salad was also pretty good.

The service was pretty fast and friendly so no complaints there.  Though I probably won't be back to this particular location because I am almost never in the area, I will go to another Buffalo Wild Wings in the future to try some other wings and sauces.",review,fFlMAm0RBdfzrDfpicTPJg

I was excited to try Sala Thai after seeing numerous strong reviews.  Overall, they did not disappoint.

We started with pork satay.  We had not seen satay offered in pork.  This was the least satisfying of the selections we had.  The pork was a little chewy and the yellow curry just didn't seem to go well with the pork.

We all shared four entrees.  We had spicy basil fried rice which was delightful and probably my favorite item overall.  I am hoping to have that again soon.  It had a nice balance of spice and fresh basil that was refreshing.  The catfish with panang curry was very nice.  It was the largest catfish fillet I have seen, cooked quickly so as to sear it lightly and some crispiness on the outside while remaining moist and tender inside.  It was heavily sauced and we ordered 4 out of 5 on the spiciness scale.  I think everyone at the table fought off a reflexive sneeze with the first bite of that one.  I would like to see how hot the 5 is, but keep in mind the 4 is pretty hot.

We also had pad thai which for me is a bit of a benchmark dish.  Sala Thai's was unique and very good.  Not overly sweet and with just the faintest hint of smokiness in the pepper flavor, rather complex for pad thai.  Rounding out the tour de Sala Thai was a duck curry with coconut milk, red chili paste, pineapple, basil, tomato and onion.  I'm not a fan of duck but this was very good.  I had several pieces of the duck and plenty of the sauce ladled over my steamed rice.

After my friends and I took in a Tito Puente Jr concert at the ampitheatre for the Scottsdale Center for Performing Arts, where we were headed to next was a cause for debate.

""Coach House!""
""Rusty Spur!""
""Mondrian!""
""Santos!""
""AZ88!""

Needless to say, me being the foreigner (ie. from Phoenix), I kept my mouth shut and let the crowd take me to wherever. I tried my best veering everyone away from Rusty Spur - something about  combining the Scottsdale scene with country music was a little more than I felt like taking in for one evening.

So we ended up defaulting to AZ88, because, well, it was right there in front of us. With a modern decor and very open seating atmosphere, it was definitely one of those ""see and be seen"" kind of places. Tables of bored gay people looking at other tables of gay people, tables of bored straight people looking at other straight people, and then the random smattering of older folk who weren't giving a rat's ass about all the whiffs of pheremones flying everywhere - they just wanted to sit at the bar and have their waffle fries and martinis in peace. 

Some long-time Scottsdale residents told me this place isn't scene-y, and that they've been going here since, well, 1988, but I beg to differ. AZ88 is definitely sceney. Not really my bag, but at least I've been here and can form my own first-hand opinion.

Apart from the human element, the place itself isn't bad. Some interesting art (ie. a big sign saying ""Smoking is the leading cause of statistics"" on the wall above the bar while three big images of cigarette smoke  hung from the windows on the opposite side of the room). Fairly stocked bar - although AZ88 definitely seemed like a froufrou drink kind of place. Bartenders were pretty quick and courteous. 

And then after one drink, when folks debated about staying longer or leaving, I opted for the latter. Not that AZ88 is harming anyone, really. I mean, people who enjoy being in front of a mirror for an hour at a time need their own version of Cheers, too. I just happen to not be one of them.

I was excited to try this place, but hadn't come sooner because it is soooo far from Mesa.  We had: Island fruity drink, meat pie, pof pofs, curry chicken, and tomato and rice stew. 

The good:
The drink was very sweet and delicious
The pof pofs tasted like salty donuts....pretty good, very dense. They kind of filled me up before I even got my entree. 
The spicy sauce (I asked for it and the waiter warned me several times that it was VERY spicy...I thought it added a lot of flavor and was tasty)

The medioce:
The density of the pof pofs
The curry chicken (I had asked our waiter what his favorite thing on the menu was and he said it was this curry chicken, but I found it somewhat lacking in flavor without the spicy sauce... made me wonder if I was being 'protected' from some of their other dishes...)
The meat pie- I thought the filling had a strange flavor, the BF really liked it though. I liked the crust. 
The stew...it was good, but not wonderful and the beef in it was somewhat fatty. 


The bad:
Service...sorry guys. We waited for our check for a looooong time. Also, we were seated in a dark corner, which was ok...but the restaurant was empty so I don't know why we were seated there. Kind of weird....
The loud music- the music was fine, just really loud.

We came here in anticipation of trying out some chocolate dipped key lime pie, only to discover that the one booth that sold it, had sold out for the night.  

In addition, when we were here it seemed like just a big conglomeration of booths, with only some of them selling chocolate.  It seemed like most of the booths were either some sort of non-food good (like jewelry, hair pins, etc) or fair-type food such as lemonade and funnel cake.

So, the food comes out like 10 minutes later.  I couldnt even finish it.  The fries were so salty and tasted weird..they were spicy I think?  My toungue didnt know what to do!  The wings were doused in BBQ sauce!  I mean buried!   It was like they went to Wendys or McDonalds, got some BBQ sauce, and poured it over the top of the wings, and wala,BBQ chicken wings.

* Side street location keeps it from the Old Town riff raff.
* I really like their presentation of the wine flights in the little mobile wire contraption.
* I didn't order any food here, so I can speak to that.
* Attentive service.
* I felt the atmosphere was a little blah. 

It's a rather large dining room with an open kitchen to one side (love open kitchens). When Bonnie and I were debating the look and decor of the place we decided on Levitz or Mor Furniture for Less.  Think boring Southwestern chaise test patterns for seating and stylized Sedona landscape paintings for art. Ick!  An article in the Arizona Republic even said the owners were puzzled as to why they kept getting the Wisconsin 40-something crowd - and well they should wonder no further. 

Other than that I really enjoyed my wine - rieslings and a sauvignon blanc, noshed on marinated olives and mixed nuts and enjoyed the company of random Yelpers. Our server was pretty attentive and checked up on us often and with each new person who arrived.

The rehab has been lovingly restored by its owner DJ Fernandes who is also not by coincidence an architect. When pulling up you can see such attention to detail and design from the concrete stamped handicapped spot, to the interesting lights and exterior brushed stainless door pulls. When entering the building be sure to check out the signage made up of letter building blocks, clever and grounding. Rehabilitation like this helps make the Phoenix area so interesting and original.


The inventive menu was designed by DJ, his girlfriend Jessica Ruiz and chef/consultant Mitch Hoverman, who interestingly also opened Palette. The idea is to share plates amongst a group of friends, though you can easily put together a traditional 3 course meal if that is what suits you best. We opted to share our plates so we could try as many as possible. To best describe the menu it would be eclectic, with Creole, French and Spanish twists. There are 3 sections to chose from, Start, Smaller Plates and For Sharing, the menu is accessible and interesting.

Starting things out, while the grilled baguette ($5) might sound ordinary, its crispy and light goodness comes from Simply Bread. Accompanied is a whole head of roasted garlic and finished with Bariani olive oil. The Bariani is essentially liquid gold with its grassy mild and pure unfiltered flavor. If there is any left in the bowl when you're done don't let the waiter take it away, it's to precious to be wasted and will taste great on just about anything. Together with the nosh plate ($7) it's all about simple clean flavors. Salted melon, Molinari &amp; Sons salami, manchego cheese and toasted pistachio's were so delicious it was hard to share though there was plenty for all. Panko walnut-crusted fontina ($6) was perfectly crunchy and with each bite the melted strands of the fontina cheese were delightful and satisfying. Patatas bravas ($5) are classic tapas however the Tuck version turns potato cubes into long thick planks served along side of 2 dipping sauces. The planks were lightly crispy and well seasoned, though dipped into the aioli and the spicy tomato sauce together was good, love came from dipping into the remaining Bariani olive oil.

Working into the Smaller Plates menu, the panini bites with prosciutto ($9) were so good we were squabbling over the last piece. A nice slab of ciabtta bread stuffed with grilled pear, taleggio cheese, arugala and honey was a sweet and savory combo that has to be tasted and savored. Order 2, one for the table and another wrapped up to go for lunch the next day. Another contrasting sweet and savory small plate would be the medjool dates stuffed with chorizo and topped with melted gruyere ($9). I've had many of stuffed dates, but never like this, spicy and sweet, chewy and meaty, very nice! The mac and cheese with crispy prosciutto, topped with breadcrumbs and lobster ($12) was sublimely creamy and tender, like a really good hug where you just melt into his arms, bury your face into his chest while you're enveloped in comfort and security. Who knew mac and cheese could make you feel so good?!

Turning our attentions to the citrus-brined fried chicken ($17) was a sight to behold. 3 large, generously battered pieces of deep fried passion caused instant salivation. I have to say that this was the juiciest tenderest fried chicken I've ever had the pleasure of sinking into. The crunchy coating, the moist flavorful chicken and the slight citrus after taste were absolute perfection. Along side was a large white cheddar waffle, slathered in maple butter and a bowl of pork laden collard greens. The waffle had a light, fluffy and almost mashed potato consistency that was fork tender and soaked up the chicken juices easily. The collards were nice and porky with that slight bitterness only tempered by salt and sugar.  This plate was simply amazing!

For the beef eaters there is a spiced skirt steak ($18) served with parmesan lentil mashed yukons and mushrooms, that was so hearty and delicious, I can't imagine having this anywhere else.

There is usually only one way to finish a good meal like this and that's with my favorite self proclaimed food group, chocolate. We all tore into the chocolate brownie and almond cream ($7) with a vengeance. You could tell with each bite that this was no box mix, crackly shininess on top, moist and crumbly, this was a great brownie. If this is too much you will also a receive a 1 bite postre with your check. On this night it was raw chocolate chip cookie dough with a slathering of melted dark chocolate, happy ending!

The stars are aligned for the Tuck Shop. With all of their elements in near perfect cohesion, this will soon be one of the coolest and freshest places to eat, drink, and of course share.",review,rQ4z0EStSZE4acgkne6Hmg

What a delightful surprise when we scored a table next to the babbling waterfall we encountered on our way in!  Nervous energy spent over Mamang feeling too chilled outside was wasted; Indeed, she even complained of feeling too warm!  No worries though, as cousin Melissa eagerly swapped places with grandma.

We shared flaming saganaki, ""award-winning"" gyro dinner (consisting of lamb and beef, scrumptious rice, sauteed veggies, and just-perfect lemon-roasted potatoes), side Greek salad, and flaming galaktoboureka (custard baked in crusty phyllo, topped with vanilla ice cream, flamed, then drizzled with caramel sauce) for dessert!  We three over-ate, but no one grumbled.  Mamang had never experienced Greek cuisine before, so this beautiful evening (outdoor dining, ambience- lighted palm trees, waterfall- and tasty food) was a perfect send-off for our gorgeous grandmother, who was homesick living on US soil for the past six months.  She left for Manila yesterday (Monday).  I hope she's happier back home... Mamang, next time you're enjoying a fresh mango shake, I hope you'll think of me!

Also, we almost missed the flame shows of both saganaki AND galaktoboureka.

For years, I've thought the Hotel San Carlos was an under-appreciated (through its own fault) downtown venue. With the Ghost, the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown Phoenix scene. This is apparent from the first step inside the lobby, which appears as it did in 1928 when the hotel first opened. If celebrities in the 1930s had to spend the night in Phoenix, back then a small, un-airconditioned cowboy town with around 50,000, they would have stayed here. (Or else the near-by Westward Ho). You get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blow-ups the Ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early 20th century downtown Phoenix. So large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets, and marvel at their bowties, cowboy hats, handkerchiefs and facial expressions. Back then, the San Carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was ""air-cooled."" (That may have meant it had swamp coolers. I haven't googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review.)

Maybe I overlooked it, but on the menu it says that this dish is yam protein. I thought, I like yams... this was not anything like a yam. It was fake shrimp! WTF, why doesn't the menu say imitation shrimp? I hate shrimp! maybe it was my fault... but seriously, wtf. The meat had the consistency of shrimp (gross) and a weird flavor that still lingers in my mouth hours later. It was dry and had no sauce, plus it wasn't spicy. It's called spicy cha cha.....

Really? No one's reviewed Co+Hoots yet? 

Co+Hoots is a great space in an old building on 7th Street near Roosevelt. It's a place for small businesses, the self-employed and anyone else interested to have a space to work that's not their house. It allows for brainstorming, socializing and bouncing ideas off others. There are both rates for drop in one time visits and for packages for full-time inhabitants. 

The work environment is an open collaborative space with meeting rooms to use when needed.

I've been there several times for both professional organization meetings and social events and every time I find it hard to leave. There's such a welcoming vibe and the creativity that abounds in that place is astounding. 

If you need a place to work for a day to get out of your element, a place to call home for your business of 1, a spot to hold a meeting or a swanky sexy space to hold an after hours gallery or social event, this is your place.

Still not convinced? Swing by and check it out. I'm sure they won't mind!!",review,BW9GH6_h_RJfpz8JY-wFdw

My girlfriend and I ordered take out from here last Friday night. Ordering from Noodles Ranch is great. The menu (which is easy to find online) has a simple letter and number code. I know this may sound uncultured, but since I cannot pronounce the names of most Vietnamese foods, I like this. 

We had the A7-Grilled Salmon Salad Rolls. Fantastic. The Tamarind dipping sauce was a little too hot for my girlfriend, but perfect for me. 
We also ordered the M2-Pho lon xao / Chow Fun (with chicken) and M1-Mi xao / Chow Mein (with chicken). Both meals were good, very similar, just differently prepared noodles. 

I do feel a little guilty about only three stars. The food is really good, not priced too bad, but it's not all that filling. Even after finishing a starter and our meals, I still had a craving for something more (guess we should've ordered a dessert). The wait for the food was also pretty long. We were told on the phone that it take about a half hour. We arrived a little less than 30 minutes later, and still waited in the restaurant for a good 10 minutes. The staff was very accommodating, and let us sit at a table while waiting, and apologized many times for the wait.

The gas station entrance is a bit odd, as you must snake through the parking lot. Moreover, the food court table layout is terrible, long rows with little space in-between; it is anything but private dining.

Yesterday I wanted a relaxing stroll, but was sick of the city, so I drove on up to Shaw Butte to do a relaxing loop. Parking in this location is limited, and a little awkward (almost slashed my tires through the do not enter section) but it doesn't seem to get as crowded and should suffice. 

The entrance has a map of the area and trails you can take. The path was fairly easy to follow and I did manage to stay on a path (tho not always the one I was supposed to be on) at all times. I also managed to get myself back to my car, so that's always a bonus. There were a few others there that had managed to get themselves lost due to unclear path marking, but one look at a map and it's easy to get your bearings straight again. 

The path was beautiful. Not completely scenic, as parts still have the road visible, but it was quiet and peaceful and the sky was gorgeous that day. I pretty much had the trail to myself most of the time with everyone pretty evenly spaced out and ended up doing some dance hiking to my iPod without injuring myself on the trail, which speaks to the ease of the hike. Not really any steep parts or loose rock on the loop trail. Perfect for low maintenance hiking days. 

It was my first trip, but I don't see it being my last. Seems like there are plenty of trails that start there that would be fun to venture on.",review,u7NV80cMLlCpepOXVfA5Hg

Golden Phoenix harkens back to those memories like no other place in town. The service is impeccible, and the owner of the restaurant remembers everyone who walks in the door, and epitomizes great service from a restauranteur. 

The food here at Golden Phoenix is your standard Chinese fair, nothing too authentic, but I hear they have a separate menu they provide to Chinese people. I've tried their Sweet & Sour Pork ($8.75) which was great, and had a very gingery sauce a little different from what I'm used to. Cashew Chickn and Kung Pao Chicken ($8.25) are both good dishes, but lacking in the sauce flavor department. Both dishes had plenty of veggies, chicken, and nuts, but were fairly bland overall. Hot & Sour soup is one of the best I've ever had, and they include plenty of medium sized shrimp, tofu, mushrooms, etc. I've had better tasting and better quality food elsewhere, but the difference is absolutely marginal.

Overall, I'd say this is a great place to go for a good ol' fashioned Chinese/American meal with your family or friends.

I am beginning to like Indian cuisine and its good that there is a place like Bombay Spice that makes it healthier.  This is good because I had no idea that ""regular"" Indian food was unhealthy.  Oops.

I've been meaning to try this place for a while and by chance I found it on Local Dines so I snatched up a $40 cert for $20 ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  Definitely a solid find for a solid place and worth it because their food isn't very expensive to begin with.

Anyway, the service was excellent and the food came out quickly.  Here is what I sampled:

* Caesar Salad - this was weird and I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't get it again.  It was just Romain lettuce  tossed with some weird Caesar-like dressing.  Our waitress said it was a weird salad but I wanted it anyway.

* Sauce Sampler w/ naan bread - this was just ok.  It was worth it though to try their sauces.  Nothing to special about it.

* Lentil Soup - I didn't like this.  It was really thick and weird.

* Tikka Skewers - Peppers, onions and chicken stir fried.  This was pretty good.

* Beef Tikka Masala, Chicken Curry, Spinach and Tofu, and Chicken Keema - all of this was very good.  I got 2 of the above and sampled the rest off of the other plates of my party.  My only real issue is that the food lacked a certain kick or pizazzz.  I guess that's what all the unhealthy stuff that other places use adds to the dish.

My dad ordered the All American burger with the harissa fries. Those fries were an instant hit, a crowd pleaser. My dad said the food at FEZ is a ""flavor explosion."" He couldn't have been happier. I ordered the FEZ salad with lamb, and was really pleased. It was hearty enough to fill me up without my feeling guilty. 

We also tried the sweet potato fries (an instant hit with my brother, who loved them beyond belief) and the hummus platter.

Folks were watching 2-3 different games and everyone thought they had a good seat for it.  That can be pretty rare in a sports bar.  And it was LOUD!  By noon or so we were having to speak pretty loudly just to hear each other.  

It was still an awesome place to watch the game.

First, I will talk about the atmosphere. It's absolutely adorable and you'd never guess just how adorable from busy Camelback Road. Hidden behind those cement walls lie an enclosed patio with a fresh herb garden and plenty of shaded seating. They also have tables in the doorway so if you are torn between eating inside or outside, there's always the option of halfway in between! 

Moving on to the food, the pizza literally melts in the mouth. I went to lunch here with fellow yelper Carolyn S who had been here many times before. She went for a pizza and said they were delicious, so I just had to do to the same and I am so happy I did! I got the Funghi pizza which has mushrooms and goat cheese, but I added mozzarella to it for that extra cheesy taste. The pizza crust is soft and crunchy in all the right places. The pizza was heavily topped with mushrooms and the cheeses and had the perfect amount of bite to it with a great taste. I could have finished every last piece but I got about half way there. The cool thing is that they have eight inch pizzas so everyone can order their own pizza which is nice since so many times, people like different pizza toppings.

They have a huge selection of beers - better than Yardhouse actually... the only thing they don't have is 100 beers on tap. They do change out their tap selections every so often, so it's worth frequenting for the beer connoisseur.

They have some really tasty food as well... beer bites and sliders and pizza on the top of the list. They have a good jukebox, darts and a bunch of board games and whatnot. It's a fun place to go with friends... it's not always really loud either so you can have a conversation. They sell some wines as well as a multitude of fantastic imported beers from around the world in bottles from glass-front refrigerated display cases. You can basically use this as a liquor store if you don't have time to stay. 

This place does also function as a brewery as the name suggests... they make some good ones too. I much prefer this place to Four Peaks - by a mile... They sometimes do promotions and raffles which is fun. Locals and regulars hang out here, but they aren't too territorial. 

The service is probably one of the only shortcomings of this place... it's not that they have bad service, it's just that it's difficult to get any sometimes... particularly when it's busy.

It was Sunday night, and it was a rather quiet low key evening, so the restaurant was not exceptionally busy.  For whatever reason, we were seated in a HUGE booth that was meant for 6 people.  There were several other open booths that were meant for a normal party of 2.  Why were we sat at the booth of 6? No idea.  go figure.

I'm very happy to report that the opposite has been true during the last 10 months for Chang's here, since they opened!

At the urging of friend Iain B., I stopped in here for lunch today to give it what he said was a much deserved ""Update"".  I was joined by Jeromy H. for this visit.

Some ""Positives"":

*  The owner lady (aka cashier, hostess, table lady) was friendly & appreciative of the business.

*  The dining area & bathroom were clean.

*  All the food was the right temperature, & identified with little signs.

*  There was tasty, complimentary hot Chinese Tea!

*  The Hot & Sour Soup was better than average, with little pieces of meat in it.

*  The Pork Fried was tasty & not greasy.

*  There was some fish out this time.

*  The rest of the food was good too, including the Egg Foo Young, which is still ""hockey puck"" style, but it was tender & tasty with the warm, yellow gravy to top it.


Negatives?

*  Small selection of 23 food items plus sauces, with no salad.  (They do put out a few small dessert choices, & I had some chocolate pudding.)

There's a TV (ugh), but it was turned low & the overall acoustics of the place are ok.  Our booth was comfortable, & we enjoyed yucking it up with some other friendly customers who were seated nearby.  For those who like to dine outdoors, there's an ok little covered patio area on the north side (see photo).

Chang's here is much improved since opening week in April '10, & it now holds it's own well against the other small westside Chinese Buffets, beating Best Wok, Golden Nugget & Him's JL, while coming in a little below May Garden, in my opinion...  SO, a high 3 Stars for Chang's this time!

I'm back.

And I see that Pierre Trudeau ran home to be the first to review Hanny's after bailing on me while I still had a drink in hand (even though I was the one who convinced him to go that evening in the first place). That's ok, though. I've already given him shit. 

So, anyway, what do we got here? A big giant space that's opened up downtown. And I've had a few return trips, so I'm ready to review. Let's get to work:

POSITIVES
- It's obvious that some massive investment went on here in redefining a decrepit department store into a giant, contemporary lounge.  A sleek seating area downstairs and there's also a second floor. More floors to eventually open, which would make Hanny's practically an epic city unto itself - if the crap-ass economy doesn't devour it first.
- Also upstairs: your own personal Hall of Mirrors - in case you missed the illustrious Arizona State Fair - and an all-white room which together constitute a great place for photographing your peers. Would work especially well if everyone was wearing black turtlenecks. Anyway.
- There is also an open elevator shaft which people can peer down into the abyss and have a tingly feeling in their special place. You know that place.
- Plus a DJ who looms overhead like a lord of the hole in the wall, but then disappears when you blink again. Where did he go? Impressive feat, that.
- Hearty pours / strong drinks, for all those who are interested in said qualities of a lounge-y establishment. 
- A place to go out in this part of downtown that isn't blasting reggeton,  has 50 TVs tuned to the Suns game, or is full of hotel guests from Oklahoma who have no idea where else to go. 

NEGATIVES
- Go here strictly for drinks. The food isn't all that great. Given how much they've invested in everything else, it's kind of surprising their menu isn't up to snuff. Some flatbread pizzas, sandwiches, and a blase choice of appetizers. Waffle fries have not made the jump from AZ88 to here (not that I was expecting or wanting waffle fries - but something more than what was offered for food). They also need to  rethink their bruschetta - not the most user-friendly experience, especially eating it at the bar.
- Something seems off about the seating upstairs. It could use a lot more couches and a lot less tables. But that's just me.
- While several of the waitstaff/barstaff have been extremely friendly, professional and courteous, others still exuded the typical AZ88 holier-than-thou attitude. You know, the ones who grade you the moment you walk in to see if you're worth their while to wait on. What is it with wearing black t-shirts that does this to people? I don't think any place can afford to lose business over bad service these days, so they better figure out what to do with those bad apples . 

So, all in all, 3.45 stars which unfortunately rounds down to 3. Even though this kind of establishment is not the type I see myself going to often, it's definitely a welcome addition to downtown and hopefully it'll succeed, given how much time, money, and energy went into it. 

And for those curious about checking it out, let it be known this space was designed for people watching.  It's one of those scene-y joints, attracting people who enjoy being seen, for whatever that's worth. If you want more casual, I'd recommend heading back up to the Roosevelt/Lost Leaf part of town.",review,6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w

I absolutely love this coffee shop and I wish I lived closer so I could become a regular here. The description says it's 1/2 coffee shop, 1/2 wine bar but it's so much more. To describe it in more detail, once you walk in, you are welcomed by a humble counter with menus and some pastries begging to be eaten. The staff is friendly and they make everything to order. Seat-yourself seating is all around you and ranges from tables for two, to tables for 10 and even couches and ottomans. It would be easy for me to get lost in translation and find myself still there hours later. Now as if all that isn't enough, just wait until you walk outside to the patio. When they say they have live music, they mean seriously live music with a stage, bleachers and plenty of additional seating. I will be coming back soon to experience a live concert because I could tell it would be fun. 

I will call this next paragraph ""Delicious:""

So I've described the excellent vibe but now let me move on to the coffee and food which is just as (if not more) important. Delicious. Absolutely delicious. I enjoyed a white chocolate peppermint latte which was as delectable as it sounds. It was the perfect combination of peppermint and chocolate with non-fat milky foam: truly perfect for a blustery fall day in the desert. For my meal, I ordered the delicious mozzarella sandwich and added turkey. It melted in my mouth and was so huge I was able to take half home with me. However, I will try to erase this tasty sandwich from my memory for I heard that they are replacing it with a new menu item soon. Tear. :( But, the menu is hearty and they even offer delicious breakfast options. 

If I could, I would make this a daily visit and I would bring my computer here and work for an entire day. They have free wi-fi and it just feels like home (or home to a funky friend of yours with eclectic style).

after a long and winding drive through residential areas, i was pleased to find this quiet and secluded spot in our desert. as we parked, i noticed a very large garden area with dozens of raised beds, and the chef perusing the goods for the meals. i love that stuff!

once inside, we were seated almost immediately. it's a simple thing, but what impressed me the most was how my water glass NEVER went below half-empty. we must have had 4-5 ""servers""....the guy who took us to our table (and chatted with us like he'd known us for years), the bread guy, the water guy, the wine guy, and our actual waitress. she was extremely friendly and didn't pester us every minute asking ""are you ready? are you ready?"" she simply watched from afar and as soon as we closed our menu, she was there. yes, we were ready. 

i had the salmon. it tasted super fresh, flaky, and with a nice light sear. and a little gamey, something some folks don't like, but i enjoy that. my gal had the halibut and it was even more flaky and light, again with a light sear and cooked to perfection. 

we had the 'frites' or french fries sprinkled with parm and chives and a truffle dipping sauce. probably our favorite thing was the beer battered mushroom side. it was a very big, deep fried weird asian mushroom thing with a sauce and it was DELICIOUS!!! tender and warm and crispy. 

and to top it all off, we split a desert which left me feeling like i should've worn my stretchy pants. pair everything with a slightly sweet pinot gris and i was set for the night.

This made for an awesome experience.  While there aren't any bleachers or concession stands, there also aren't any fences or barriers keeping you away from the players.  This is the way spring training should be.  I am going back again this week and will keep going back as long as the Sounders do.",review,qduzJZxh_EH6GERI2x_zuw

We had a gift card valid for dinner for two, and we were waiting for the perfect night to use it.  Friday night was just cool enough to sit outside and enjoy the patio at Il Terrazzo, and we did just that...

Service was spot on, ambiance was great, and food did not disappoint either.  I forgot how much I am a fan of the Phoenician's homemade bread until our basket came... pair that with the dirty martini I ordered and I was one happy camper!  But of course we didn't stop there.  I had a Caesar Salad and J went with the Caprese Salad to start.  He ordered Veal Ravioli for the next course and of course I had to try it... it was creamy and heavy but in a good way.

Sadly, I don't think this dream will come true anytime soon, but because of that I cherish anytime I get a spa day and I'm pleased that my visit to Agave Spa was everything I hoped it would be!

The Westin Kierland itself is gorgeous and flawless, but it has more of a concrete decor feel to it. It doesn't have the Old Phoenix feel to it like some, but it's clean, gorgeous and flawless just the same. The Agave Spa has just the same feel. 

Walking in, I immediately caught wind of the delicious signature scent of the spa. It smelled so good, I wanted to put the scent in my bag and keep it with me at all times. The staff was extremely friendly right off the bat and quickly showed us to the ladies locker room to get us settled. I like to arrive to the spa as early as possible in order to enjoy as much time there as possible. 

Once I was settled in, I first used the gym to feel better about the pampering I would be doing later. As hard as it is to actually work out on a spa day, it makes me feel so much better and I've added it to my spa routine. But, I make sure I do it when I first arrive. The gym is refreshing because it overlooks the pool. The treadmill is state of the art, offered me way more options than I needed and even had a tv built inside. After my workout, it was time for the massage. The 50 minutes massage was just what the doctor ordered! The masseuse was friendly but not overly chatty which I really appreciate in a masseuse. The room felt refreshing and the music was soothing. The only problem I had with the room was that it was a little too bright for my liking, but then they put a scented mask on my eyes which helped. 

After my heavenly massage, we continued our girls day out and winded down in the jacuzzi, ordered lunch and drinks while we laid out at the tranquil adult's-only pool and used every amenity the spa had to offer. I decided to shower at the spa because the showers are gorgeous with the popular Westin shower heads and delicious Kai products. They even offer limeade in addition to water and tea to quench your thirst. The entire day was tranquil, relaxing and an excellent way to cool off during the extreme heat. If I could, I would have purchased every Kai Fragrance product they were selling, but the pocketbook wouldn't allow. It's officially on my wish list though!

Luckily for me, I wasn't stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joe's Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they don't live in a city and, I'm sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything.

Anyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didn't bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They weren't really my thing but the wife enjoyed.

This place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joe's BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and I'm sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away.

I know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joe's BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit.",review,QnAzW6KMSciUcuJ20oI3Bw

Tee Pee was one of the first places to popularize Mexican food for gringos, from what I gather. Non-mexican families began going out to eat here regularly and Mexican cuisine became part of the Arizonan identity. 

Unfortunately, I don't feel like their food holds up in comparison anymore. The authenticity has faded and given way to a new generation of Az-Mex, one that I prefer, if for even reasons of circumstance.

I was lucky enough to get one of ten seats for the kick-off of The Farm Sessions... what a treat.

For those that don't know, The Farm Sessions will take place each week at the Farmers Market from now through the end of the season (May 29, 2010).  Each Saturday, a local chef will demonstrate (to a group of ten people), as they shop the farmers market and prepare a dish using fresh ingredients.  Viking is the main sponsor, and I believe the space itself is there thanks to the Chef's Loft as well.  But The Farm Sessions' concept is thanks to Joe Garcia, who brought his vision to fruition - kudos for that!

Today's session was led by Chef James Porter of Petite Maision.  He did an incredible job, keeping the session fun and interactive.  I learned a ton and I scored one of the eco-friendly totes as well.  Chef James made it look easy to create a gourmet meal of pork chop with salad and goat cheese and a fresh melon drizzled with honey and goat cheese for dessert.  

Our group of foodies followed James around the market and found the ingredients from the following vendors:
-Made By Bees
-Triple V Farm
-Rhiba Farms
-On the Vine
-Seacat Gardens
-Queen Creek Olive Mill
-Pork on a Fork

While today was free since it was the first one, going forward, the cost will be $40 per ticket and participants will receive enough ingredients to prepare the same dish at home for two, a recipe card, shopping/resource list and a market shopping tote.

I am excited to see the line-up of chefs that are participating for future sessions - I am sure this will sell out each week, so plan on purchasing your tickets early!  (You can do so on their website).",review,6NP9s9odL5UfKdei_qQAog

Sure, I moved less than a mile from where I used to live, but anyway...

After running around doing a bunch of stuff, I thought about grabbing some Thai food. I've driven by Wild Thaiger a number of times but hadn't eaten there yet. So, today was the day.

Given that I was dining solo tonight, I brought a book to read. I went in and the place was packed. I told the hostess I'd rather sit outside on the patio since it was more quiet. So I sat around and waited for a while as I was listening to, well, Arabic pop music wafting through the speakers (don't get me wrong, I like Arabic music a lot, but at a Thai restaurant?). 5 minutes later the hostess came back out with my water. But it was10 minutes after that which my server finally showed up. Strike number one.

I ordered the Wild Wrap (spicy diced chicken that you eat by rolling it up in cabbage leaves) and the Holy Basil Chicken. About 15 minutes later the appetizer came. The server then promptly left without giving me any napkin or other utensils. Strike two. 

I walked back inside and flagged down a different waitress to ask for napkins. She looked at me funny. I told her, ""Hey, the other guy didn't give me any napkins, what can you do?"" 

So I ate the Wild Wrap. Not so great. I've had much better elsewhere (namely San Francisco). Still edible, but I wasn't really enjoying it. 10 minutes later the waiter came with the holy basil chicken. 

""You don't have any utensils?""

""No, you didn't give me any.""

""Oh.""

So instead of the paper napkin the other waitress gave me, I finally get a cloth napkin with a fork and knife. I'm now sitting hoping the dish is going to be worth all this waiting and extraneous trouble.

It wasn't. 

The sauce was alright, I guess, but the chicken pieces were dry and I'd give the whole dish just 3 stars. Throughout this entire time no one came outside once to check on how I was doing or to refill my water. I was beginning to get bad flashbacks to my Autumn Court experience. Strike three. Wild Thaiger was out.

5 minutes after I finished the waitress came out to refill my water (um, I'm done) and told me she'd go get my check. No ""Would you like dessert?"" because apparently single guys with books don't eat dessert. The waiter comes out 5 minutes later with the bill and gives a super friendly thank you. Uh, thanks for being nice and all now, but this is the first time I've seen you since you put the plate on my table. 

I don't know if because I brought a book with me that these people summed up that ""he must be a lousy tipper so we don't need to pay much attention to him."" WRONG. I'm a great tipper if and when I get good service. For whichever reason I was ignored, though, my tip's going to reflect that.

The fantastic movie theater, Jutenhoops, Alpine Ski Keller, Bear Cover, and even Ed Debevics are all long gone... oops, there I go bringing up the past. Seriously though, these were painful to lose - one by one.

So today, there's a Linens 'n' Things which is hardly unique, and a Trader Joe's which is nice to have in the area, and also a Sister's Attic and Closet upscale thrift stores which add a bit of much-needed flavor. The Chili's, the Bookstar, and Black Angus are still around. So is the jewelry store that has never really offered a compelling reason to enter. They've wedged an LA Fitness here and they've also added a Blimpie and an Arby's... all very healthy choices.

It was the perfect choice since they have some of the tastiest Vietnamese in North Scottsdale, well; it's the only Vietnamese in North Scottsdale.

Tearing into the menu she ordered Edamame ($3.99). Being a super food she knows that it's good for her figure as well as her mouth. The young soybean pods are steamed then lightly salted just put one between your lips and pull. The tender soybeans simply shoot out into your mouth the taste is salty and the texture creamy, you can't go wrong with this healthful treat. Keeping with the lighter side she ordered the Grilled Pork & Egg Roll Vermicelli Noodles ($7.99). This is more of a salad with its ample portion of rice noodles with lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumber, and cilantro topped with crushed peanuts and grilled pork chop. Served along side is a bowl of prepared fish sauce which is sweet and salty but not fishy.  This combination not only satisfies her hunger but understandably calms her down. 

She rests now, her cravings eased for the time being but for how long? Nobody knows.",review,jf4RUa9EQO37hqxRCxbEXQ

That about sums it up - women love this place, and go there to drink wine and be silly and talk about books from oprah's book club.

I get it - there's a pianist, and fresh cut flowers and ""florist"" and ""café"" are right in the name. it's got ""silly wine women"" painted all over it. When my friend picked this spot as the place for our regular hh get-together for some late 20's 9-5ers it made sense. I went to the web site to check on pricing. I was annoyed to see salads for $15, sandwiches for not much less. No happy hour specials? Now I'm downright pissed. Then I went to check out some reviews and was surprised that so many yelpers had given it poor reviews for service and food quality. How do they justify the prices? And what's this about _microwaving_ the food?!

But, my friend had been looking forward to trying MFC, so I zipped my lip and showed up. I like the space - the long, floor-to-ceiling storefront style windows let light stream in and the décor is simple and airy. I was the first to arrive and told the host who was at the front (I guessed a manager as he had an air of importance and hurriedness about him and wore a different colored shirt than the rest of the staff) there would be five of us. His response: ""ooooooooooo-kaaaay."" Nice attitude. Then, ""Do you not have a reservation?"" um, for five people at 5 o'clock? No, of course not. It was not busy at all, but he made a big show of wandering around the restaurant, finger to mouth and looking perplexed about my request.

Finally I offered to sit at the bar until the rest arrived and continued to go ""WTF?"" when discovering there wasn't a glass under $12 or a bottle under $50. Again, how is this justified?

When two other girls arrived about 10 min later, I flagged him down and said ""we're ready for a table,"" and he again seemed noticeably annoyed (so much so that the other girls commented on it). I had envisioned MFC was hh hot spot, especially on a Friday, and kept waiting for it to fill up, but it never did and I still don't understand the issue.

OK- one good, important point to note, our actual server was awesome. She was friendly, helpful and attentive. Gave informed suggestions/opinions when asked, etc. Then I found out that bottles were half off: ok, that's a little better. (Then one of the girls mentioned that bottles are half off all day, every day... Then why not put that price on the menu? To uphold some image of pretention? I don't get it and I'm back to annoyed).

We got the Willow bread basket to share. The herbed butter overpowered the taste of the fresh breads and I had maybe half a piece (I'm a bread addict and surprised I didn't devour all of it - just wasn't that good. The best one was the cranberry). I ordered the ""nachos"" app for $8 and it was ok (one-inch bread slices smothered in jalapeño-cheese with avocado and salsa on the side). One girl got a wrap and loved it. Another got lobster bisque and said it was just ok. After everyone was done and had formed their own opinions on their meals, I shared my findings on no stove/microwave situation. They were all pretty shocked, especially in light of the prices.

I was disappointed that the live music I had heard so much about didn't start up until 7, right when we were getting ready to leave. I really don't think any of us had an experience that would draw us back.

First of all, I want to wrap the Arcadia Farms Marketplace up and put it in my pocket; it's so cute inside and out! It's like a dream farmhouse and one I could be quite comfortable in for hours. Maybe it has something to do with the tasty sweets and treats staring me in the face too.

The marketplace is stocked full of food for all and friendly staff serving it. I always loved visiting the Phoenix Art Museum Arcadia Farms because I'd have a great chat with Lisa G. So, needless to say how pleased I was when I walked into the Marketplace to see her behind the counter! We had a great chat and she told me all about the wonderful items they serve! They have everything from tea packets and flowers to scones, cookies, brownie pops and nutella. They also have their miniature cakes ready for purchase as well as their tasty iced tea and lemonade. The salads are pre-made every morning and waiting in the refrigerator to be eaten. They have tuna nicoise, turkey club, their famous strawberry chicken salad, a garden salad, pasta salad and chicken curry salad with raspberry sauce. They also have a detailed breakfast and sandwich menu that are made-to-order. Besides a couple classics, this menu is different and it's lower in price. The sandwiches range from roast beef and mozzarella and to pressed chicken. They have a lot of options on the menu. I also heard they are introducing a limited dinner menu. It's still not a ""cheap"" meal, but it's competitive to other lunch options out there at about $8-$9 for a sandwich and $8-$9 for a salad. 

So now that I've given a recap of what I saw at the marketplace, I will report on what I ate! It was tough...so tough to decide between a sandwich and salad. I wanted both! Then the more I looked at the chicken curry salad, the more appealing it looked, so I opted for that. Verdict? Very pleased!! The chicken curry has a sweetness to it and then the raspberry dressing is the perfect addition. Arcadia Farm's pesto shrimp salad is addicting and I think that this one might be up there with that level of addiction! It was the perfect size and filled me up without making me want to roll out of there. For my beverage, I went for the raspberry ice tea. And yes, today I decided my sweet tooth would win over my willpower, so I took a lemon cake muffin for the road. In summary, it was a very summeresque meal and very fulfilling! I sat outside at their tables in the front. I wish they had indoor seating but it seems like the indoor seating is only for the private event catering. But then again, this is a marketplace and the purpose is for people to get in and out. 

Speaking of the private catering room, it is absolutely adorable in there. Arcadia Farms is the perfect place for a bridal or baby shower or ladies lunch, but the restaurant itself can be a little cramped so it makes it hard. Therefore, this is a great alternative! If I ever need to plan a ladies-only party, hands-down this will be my first choice. 

In summary, I definitely see myself becoming a regular at the Arcadia Farm's Marketplace. I still love the sit-down Arcadia Farms, but when I don't have time to sit down and have a ladies lunch, I'm very happy that they've given me this alternative!!",review,A-M-ebgWSjHTXi9S6tvchw

Truth be told, this could not compare with the meat in the gyro dinner I just had a few nights before at MBFGR, but for the price (around $6), it made for a quick and satisfying lunch (and the extra feta in the pita didn't hurt, either)!  While the gyro is not made in-house, AE does have it shipped in three times a week from Chicago, so I was told by the man behind the counter.

Baklava looked awesome, but I couldn't try it since it contained an allergen, but no worries since any item offered here would be fulfiiling enough!",review,odhXwWaYZvD_icIN6f_DbA

this is a fairly large pub complete with brass accented bar and hardwood floors. the food is super English/Irish with Shepard's Pie and other ""meat and potatoes"" fare. not cheap, but it's unique and good, so it's worth it.

there is live music every weekend, and possibly during the week, too. i think weekends after 10 they start charging a cover, but it's only like $3. it can get really loud inside, especially with the live music, but thankfully, there's a huge outdoor courtyard area with a bar, which is where i spend my time there.

the crowd can be college, but not obnoxious college, it's a laid back crowd of students and older folk, too. the place can get pretty busy during the semester, and sometimes the wait at the bar is frustrating.

First off, this place has tons of character, inside & out.  I found it to be very comfortable & fun, right off the bat.

Soon after getting settled in, a basket of cornbread, along with soft, whipped butter, landed on the table, & it was incredibly good!  One bite & my rating of the place soared from ""Start"" to 4-Stars!  At Daren C's recommendation, a Smokehouse Burger was ordered, along with shoestring potatoes, & Amanda K's review called for an order for the Smoked Link Sausage platter, & macaroni & cheese, & beans were the side dishes picked to go along with that.

The burger & the macaroni & cheese both qualified as candidates for the best I've ever had of each... just amazingly good!!  Everything else was excellent too, & at the end a little bag containing a couple of tasty mini donuts arrived, adding to the fun of it all.  The service was friendly & attentive too.  This is a great restaurant!!

6724,"{'funny': 2, 'useful': 3, 'cool': 2}",user_42,FOuC9ei4vtZL3EyK9RzAMg,1,2009-07-18,"Last weekend I decided to go on a hunt to see if I could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model. I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.

I already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don't want to end your day wanting to staple things to people's heads, I would stay away from this dealership.

I walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I'm also a car fanatic. 

I didn't mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory. 

Soon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.

We all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool. 

I told him that the trade in value wasn't acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.

Since it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn't desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn't want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.

Things quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don't put enough miles on my car and it's stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I'm out then. If that wasn't enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn't know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn't comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.

In the end I let him know that this wasn't going anywhere and that I didn't think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, ""You can have whatever you want.""

I was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore. 

Slightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn't want to write a novel here unless it was wanted. Oops I guess I already did :)",review,_SNUn-zCwX_r-xaztpSjpg

He had eaten there before but it was my first time there and I was excited by all the fun options to customize your burger. I got a 1/3 pound burger on a chipotle bun with ketchup, mustard, pickle and haystack onions. I also got an order of sweet potato fries and a chocolate shake. 

The girl taking the order was extremely friendly and offered me a cup for water since my shake would take a while. But it really wasn't long at all before someone brought out our food. Unfortunately they had forgotten the haystack onions on my burger and it took a while to come back after that. While we waited, I took in the ambiance of the place. I know some reviewers criticized it as too trendy but I have to say that I liked the decor. And I also enjoyed the music selection. Given that kind of vibe and the fact that they serve some good bottled beer, this would almost be a place to meet some friends after work. However, instead of that kind of crowd it was mostly middle-aged couples, obviously out on a weekend excursion to the nearby Lowe's, each with 2+ kids in tow. 

However much I do enjoy trendiness, I think the food is still the most important aspect of a restaurant. And I did not enjoy my burger half as much as I thought I would. I don't mind the fact that it is smashed thin and overcooked - I like them very well done. But it was so greasy, it just really didn't have a good flavor at all. And the chipotle bun tasted like a regular white bread to me, I did not get any spiciness from it at all. I love sweet potato fries but these were inconsistently cooked.

Yep, I said it. I'm their number one freaking fan. Where do I start? 

Location and History: inside the historic Clarendon Hotel. If you don't know the story of Don Bolles -- the Arizona Republic reporter who was murdered by the PHX mafia in the hotel's parking lot -- then acquaint yourself on some crazy PHX background. The hotel has some (rather poorly enlarged, unfortunately) newspaper clippings and photos on this throughout its hallways that lead to the bathroom. Anyway, look up the story, then drop some knowledge on your fellow diners -- they will certainly appreciate the space on a whole new level.

Food: Reasonably priced and yum-yum. Tortas, street-style tacos, Mexi brunch, dessert (fresh fruit and crema is light, sweet and perfect end to, say, a giant carna asada burrito), I love it all. I cannot rave enough about their Ejote, or Mexican Grilled Corn. I make everyone I take here try it and have turned them all into addicts. Not to mention, their food is from local farms and much of it is organic...say, what?? For the price, the taste and the guilt-free experience, you simply cannot beat it. I have one note of warning, do NOT get sucked into the curiosity surrounding their Chicharron de Queso (which comes with the quip on their menu: ""This is NOT a quesadilla, gringos""). It's basically fried cheese. Sounds so simple and weird that you think Well, it must be more than it sounds, to be on the menu! Nope, it tastes just like the bits of shredded cheese that fall out of your grilled cheese onto the skillet and get half burnt. But everything else I've tried gets a thumbs up. 

Live entertainment and extras: Flamenco music and dancing demos every Wednesday = awesome. Held inside the lobby (viewable from most seats in the dining room) or on the roof when it's cooler. Sunday cool baby night -- DJs and hipster mingling on the roof, complete with makeshift bar.

Odds and Ends: The pool area and roof top. Pool area is fantastic with its brightly colored tile, water wall of glass and cacti. Soothing, beautiful and a great spot for out-of-towners to relax. Not to mention the City of Phoenix logo sculpture, which, as Bonnie G pointed out, is a great spot to snag photos with your visiting friends and family. The roof top area is just perfect -- a great view of the city, tons of comfy padded patio furniture. 

Between getting to tell newcomers about the cool history, take them up to the roof and introduce them to the Valley's best Ejote, this is my top ""hidden gem"" in Phoenix. I take my parents here and I take dates here, it's just that versatile and cool.  As such: Number. One. Fan.",review,-sC66z4SO3tR7nFCjfQwuQ

Nothing fancy about the seating arrangements - basic tables and chairs, plus four leather chairs set by the door for leasurely reading-chatting (lots of reading material available behind the espresso machine). Walls are a warm, dark orange - not quite burnt sienna/raw umber territory but leaning in that direction (yeah, I view the world according to Crayola, wanna fight about it?) with random local art hanging. Light is just enough to do your reading/working, not too bright. Music selection is perfect: smooth electro-Brazilian-lounge stuff that you can easily put in the background and not let it distract you, but still relaxing. 

As for the food and drink offerings: pastries/cookies for eats. Don't know if they actually make anything sandwich-wise (if they don't, I'd recommend going to Little India in the same shopping center for some chaat and then coming here). My medium decaf soy latte was decent - nothing amazing but the soy milk wasn't burnt or curdled so that's a plus. Barista was extremely courteous, and even threw away a shot he wasn't impressed with.

Their advertised free-WiFi wasn't working tonight - so the rating's going to slip a little, but not too much. Every coffeehouse has their WiFi snafus now and then, and I'll give these guys the benefit of the doubt that this doesn't happen too often.

Crowd looks mostly like ASU upperclassmen/grad students working on an assortment of theses, and I get the feeling that's the usual evening scene here. Mellow and not too loud, so a great place to get your work done. They're only open till 10 though, which for a student-heavy coffeehouse seems a little odd. 

In conclusion, I'd say Steve's Espresso is a great coffeehouse for what it is. If I lived closeby I could definitely see myself coming here often, with or without a laptop. However, I don't live closeby - so who knows how many future trips I'll be making.

Lowdown Cafe is located at a random, non-impressive intersection of 24th & Osborn*, with a McDonald's lording over the same corner. But don't let that fool you. Lowdown is a great change of pace once you're inside. 

First, the place is small - probably seating room for 14 customers max, but it's got a nice feel to it. Local art, bookshelf with reading materials, and light mostly coming from outside. 

Next, the food. The menu is mostly a whole assortment of wraps, plus some salads and the soup of the day, along with a few breakfast items. Each wrap comes with a bag of Sun Chips and will put you back around $5 - $6.50. I chose the rosemary chicken, which included roasted red pepper, grilled eggplant, arugula, tomatoes, onion, and balsamic (I eschewed the feta for obvious reasons). The lady who's working there (she looked like the owner) took my order and proceeded to make my order along with the ones before mine. 

Now, the tag line of Lowdown Cafe is ""For the low tech lifestyle"" and after reading Sarah K's review it all makes sense. The place should be called ""Slowdown Cafe"" because that's exactly what I was feeling. Sure, the owner was busy prepping all the wraps, but she wasn't rushing and maniacally trying to get each order out under 2 minutes. I immediately started regretting that *I* was in a rush and had to get my order to take back to the office. Because, in all truth, I just wanted to sit there and relax with my food, and not think about, well, my high tech lifestyle for a while. So I stood there, telling myself to just chill out and take it easy. Who knew a little hole-in-the-wall that makes wraps  could put your life into perspective?

As for the wrap itself, it was great. Just as good as some of the ones I've had at That's A Wrap and maybe even better. I also enjoyed a rich, dense, and chewy chocolate chip cookie. Good stuff, I tell you. The downside of this place is it's breakfast and lunch only (open 7-3 weekdays, 8-2 on Saturdays), but I'll deal with that and come here whenever I can. 

So 4 stars for now, hopefully more star wattage when I try some of the other wraps. Definitely recommended (but not if you're in a hurry).

Generally clean, pretty busy for 11:30 on a Thursday, but not bad at all.  There wasn't any fresh coffee brewing, as their should be, but most of this Scottsdale crowd had already been or was headed to Starbucks anyhow.",review,PtqfFmnwf6e1JzeADwU_Yg

The Habit is more of a fast casual dining experience, where you order at the counter and they have you pick up your food when it's ready.  The place is well decorated, colorful and had a decent menu selection to choose from.  Prices are fair, but I did have a few issues with how they rang up my order.

For starters, you can get a basic burger combo for $5.95.  This includes fries and a drink.  Awesome!  Plus, you can refill your drink a lot, which is a bonus since I go through a bit of pop when I eat out.  The down side?  If you want anything else but the regular fries, its going to cost you, and that upset me.  I didn't want the regular fries and I wanted sweet potato fries instead as a treat.  The down side?  They charged me a la carte for my order instead of the value meal price, so my order was twice as much as I was hoping it would be.  I think the sweet potato fries ended up being $2.95, or something ridiculous like that.  I mean, I understand an extra 50 cents, but really?  a la carte? UGH.  I mean, the foods good, but not THAT good.

Service here was nice and friendly.  The manager walked around to make sure we were happy with our order, and the food was filling and tasty.

Pakistani food *is* like Indian food. More accurately, Punjabi food. That's because more than half of Punjab actually remained in Pakistan during the partition of India in 1947, and Punjab is far and away the most populous province, thus heavily influencing the national cuisine. Punjabi cooking revolves around the tandoor, a clay oven to grill meats and chicken and bake naans to crispy, doughy perfection. Because of this, when Pakistanis go out to eat, they judge restaurants by how good their tandoori specialties are, and not as much the curries or vegetarian dishes (because everyone eats those nightly at home anyway). And there is one ingredient commonly found in Pakistani cuisine that you'll be hard-pressed to find in an Indian restaurant: beef. Lots and lots of beef. Whether it's ground for seekh kebabs or its shanks slow cooked into a spicy stew called nihari and topped with fresh ginger, cilantro, fresh squeezed lemon juice and green chili, beef plays an important role in Pakistani cooking. 

There is one dish, though, that is not typical of Pakistani cooking. Actually, it's not typical of Indian cooking either:

Chicken tikka masala.

That's because chicken tikka masala was created in England, NOT the Punjab. It's the chop suey of south Asian cuisine, and to me, depressing when so many people judge Indian restaurants by this one dish that no Indian or Pakistani person I know has ever grown up eating. When I first told my mom I went to a restaurant and had chicken tikka masala, she responded, ""What the hell is that?"" This coming from a woman whose father had one of the busiest restaurants in Karachi back in the day.

All that said, let's get to Z-Grill itself (my apologies for the long-winded intro). It's the mini-restaurant nestled in the far corner of Zam Zam Market. You walk up to the counter to order, and then sit in one of three small adjacent booths. No real fine dining atmosphere, as you're eating in a market. The Z-Grill serves both the aforementioned seekh kebabs and nihari, along a number of other dishes such as goat karahai (a curry dish), chicken biryani (a spiced rice dish with chicken), reshami chicken (skewered boneless chicken breast pieces), samosas, and on the weekends, aloo paratha (a flatbread stuffed with spiced potatoes) and a plate of channa/halwa/aloo bhaji with puris (a traditional but diet-busting brunch dish consisting of fry bread, spiced garbanzos, spiced potatoes, and sweet halva made from semolina). 

I've eaten here on a couple occasions now, and must say that even though the menu is pretty limited (barely any curries - and no chicken tikka masala), what they do make is really tasty and is definitely worth the drive over. First trip I had the chicken biryani, which was full of flavor and also full of chicken (very important), and some tasty seekh kababs, accompanied by raita and kachumbar (our version of pico de gallo). The biryani was a little greasier than it needed to be, so I hope they temper using so much oil next time. 

Second time was a couple hours ago, this time bringing Ayesha S along with me. I was starving and ordered way more than necessary. I ordered an aloo paratha and the weekend brunch plate, Ayesha an aloo paratha and reshami chicken. Drink selection in the little fridge included a number of Arab yogurt drinks, Indian sodas Thums Up, Limca and Miranda and Pakistani soda Pakola (in both original cream soda and lemon-lime flavors). I think my paratha was great and was also pretty filling. Which was too bad, because I could hardly make a dent in my brunch plate. But from what I did taste, the halwa, channa, aloo bhaji and the puris were all really tasty and could quickly become a big danger for me as I try to lose my November/December gut. Prices are reasonable and you pay at the cash register in the front of the market. They need to work on the music, which is this morose Arabic violin playing on an endless loop. Kind of incongruous with the rest of the place, but that's a minor detail.
----
In conclusion, Z-Grill is not going to be a prime destination for if you want the full on Indian dining experience. The menu is limited to a select number of Pakistani/Punjabi items which the owner, who is from Lahore, has taught his small team of cooks to do, but do well. They have a weekday lunch buffet which is limited to just four dishes, and its casual atmosphere may make it a better option for takeout. But the food is the real deal, and I am happy.

4 stars for now.

Someone walked by and dropped menus off on our table like a ninja and we began reading through the foreign novel.

My egg rolls came out before the Pho and they were quite delicious.  I have no idea what was in them, but they were full of flavor and meaty goodness.  I gobbled them up pretty quickly.

I just watched everyone else in the restaurant and figured it out that it's all personal preference.

Chipotle uses naturally raised meats, hormone free dairy, no eggs or nuts, organic beans, seasonal produce, and promote recycling within the restaurants. This means that they care what you are putting into your body and what it is doing to the environment!! (score!)

Their simple menu makes ordering easy, but still allows you variety (Burrito, Salad, Tacos, Bowls) and caters to a carnivore, vegetarian, or vegan. In fact, they are pretty ""food-allergy"" safe in general. (Believe me, I have experience)

As if the food wasn't enough, they have two amazing ordering systems: Iphone App and Online Ordering. Let's talk about this online ordering system here for a minute, because it is what I think really sets the bar high for their competitors and other restaurants in general:

I run a medium sized business and when lunch comes around, my Operations staff of ten has the WORST time executing something as simple as a lunch order. I know this sounds ridiculous, but believe me, it is as true as the day is long. This all changed when I discovered Chipotle Online Ordering. 

Anyway, I go online, login, and tell the system I want a group order. It then emails each of my employees giving them a link to order or a link to decline. If they choose to order, the link takes them right to an online order page with pictures, places for memos, etc. They select exactly what they want and it gets added to our group order.

Once everyone has ordered, I hit submit, pay by credit card, and fifteen minutes later you arrive at Chipotle, give them a jingle, and they will actually bring the food right out to your car for you. They call this the ""valet"" service. Perfect if you can't find a spot or it is raining out!!

Chipotle Executives must have sat down and thought of every pain a company could have in ordering lunch because I honestly cannot think of one thing that would improve this process. (Well, delivery would be nice... but that is what I have a receptionist for)

I know this probably sounds crazy, but I swear on my right hand it is true. EVERY time I have ever eaten here (we are talking dozens of times) my food has been fabulous! I can taste the LOVE! 

Oh, and about two hours after pickup, someone calls to ask how everything was and to let you know that they took special care to pack it up and make sure everything was right. If there is a Best Chipotle award, this location deserves it!

My final note: I get the salad with black beans, rice, tomato salsa, green tomatillo salsa, and guacamole. 100% vegan, 100% delicious. Under 500 calories, 17g of fat, and 14g of protein. And I am full. REAL full. 

Since I have started eating Chipotle 3-4 times a week, I have actually started losing weight. Perhaps I will be the next Jared!",review,Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg

I totally dig the wide-open kitchen setting. It had that nostalgic feel like I was in an old school Italian kitchen with some modern seating arrangements.  We sat at the bar and ordered ""the Pig"" - pretty much a meat lovers pizza, minus the Hut and Dominos haha.  Needless to say, wowwwwwo! I love the pizza, not because I was hungry, but wooosh the sauce was popping and the cheese was so soft and stringy!  The meat atop was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of saltiness to give it an extra flare. Oooof!  Definitely coming back!

That was my first reaction when I discovered the Mill Ave Mojo conveniently located on the well-populated strip and just a hop and skip from the light rail. They get a point off the bat for situating themselves on a college campus. College students love their fro yo and the collegiate grad in me loves it too. In fact, it might be in my top ten food categories if stranded on an island. I like this Mojo because it's spacious, clean and they have a nice variety of flavors.When I visit, I feel like I've entered from a busy city street. The staff is welcoming and friendly and ready to answer any questions. 

But moving on to the most important part - the yogurt. Mojo yogurt is perfectly creamy. It's hard not to fill up an entire bowl because it's just so good. While it can lean towards the pricey side, on a warm day or evening, it's the perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth craving and cool off at the same time. Benches surround the location so it's easy to find a seat and relax while enjoying the frozen treat. 

I tend to vary between the chocolate with fruity pebbles route and the tart with pineapple and strawberries route.

I already hate that the yogurt is always soft at these self-serve yogurt places, but it was really bad at this Mojo.  When my girlfriend pulled the lever for the chocolate it came out very soupy.  The girl at the counter told her that it always comes out that way.  If that's the case, the manager should probably look into getting that machine fixed. 

On the plus side, the sample cups are left up front, so it's easy to test a flavor without having to ask.  The storefront is set up nicely considering it's so small.

For an appetizer we had crispy spring rolls, which were pretty much your average spring roll. Not too bad, but nothing fancy or exceptionally spectacular either.

For dinner I decided to try their version of Evil Jungle Princess with medium spice as I usually get. Typically medium ranges from tolerable to almost not tolerable. This time it tasted like they had put absolutely no spice in at all. It wasn't bad and I did bring the rest home to hav tomorrow, but it's not nearly as flavorful as other Thai places I have been to in the past.

AZ 88 was not entirely what I'd expected; in some ways this was good, in others not so much, but there are a few scenarios where I'd feel inclined to run back as fast as I can. Unfortunately, they are doing a few things here that I just can't jive with, and I'm not entirely sure why they are doing them. My visit was early on a Wednesday night, no sign of the ""gay bar vibe"" that I'd been told about, instead it was an eclectic mix of tourists, large groups of friends, gay couples, older more sophisticated looking types, etc. It was nice to be in an old town restaurant that was both bar centered and drew a more sophisticated clientele. I'm also glad it wasn't a gay bar, like many had ""warned"" me that it would be. 

Bar service here was attentive and helpful, but the one bartender they had on was far too busy to answer any questions I had about the menu or drinks, which was unfortunate, because he seemed like he would be happy to help if not for being so overwhelmed with work by himself. While I waited THIRTY minutes for my Au Proive II Burger, I overheard the couple next to me talking about their past sex lives... not something I cared to listen to, and while not the restaurant's fault, it made the exhorbant wait for my burger even longer. I could have stomached the wait a little better if this place had even one television. I wasn't into the thumping house music and virtually no visual stimulation. 

The burger itself here was very well prepared, extremely tasty, and served with a nice array of fruit, veggies, and waffle fries. It had a great Burgundy sauce, bleu cheese, and bacon. The burger itself was peppercorn crusted and delicious. 

The bottom line: AZ 88 serves up some pretty good food, and provides a fun atmosphere that I feel is best for large, loud groups. Solo diners need not apply. Prices here are out of control. One burger with no drinks and a 15% tip = $16.50",review,JhupPnWfNlMJivnWB5druA

Ever wondered about the origin of our major arterial street, Indian School? This is it, folks. ""The"" Phoenix Indian School was opened by the federal government in 1891, known then as the United States Industrial Indian School. And let's not beat around the bush regarding historical truth. The U.S. Indian Commissioner at the time declared in his opening day speech, ""It's cheaper to educate Indians than to kill them."" Which says it all. This school was part and parcel of a sad period of US history when our forefathers imposed an ""Anglo-conformist"" indoctrination program on our Native American brothers and sisters. Native Americans were sent to this school from throughout the western states, including California, Oregon, Colorado and Arizona, to be stripped of their cultural identity, forced to speak English, and learn how to be, I guess, ""a real 'Merican."" How utterly absurd, and ironic.

But history is what it is, and it lives and breathes at this park where the school and many of its buildings still stand preserved today. The rest of the park features a soothing man-made lake, beautiful fields of grass, amusing sculptures, ramadas for local events, a dog park, and a great running path. There is a massive, beautifully lit at night, American flag in the center of the park, that honestly gives me goose bumps every now and then from how gracefully it is presented. 

The park is deeply intertwined with Phoenix's identity in my view, even though it was only created (as a park) in 2001. In part because of the history of the Indian School. In part because of its proximity to our downtown business community. In 2005, I ran an unforgettable and emotionally charged September 11 memorial 5K race here, so it's a part of my own ""Phoenix story"" as well. 

In mid-2007, two news helicopters with 4 people on board, 2 of whom were familiar faces to millions of Phoenicians, collided and crashed onto the park grounds, killing all of them. How amazing that the collision would occur here, in this park, instead of just a few dozen yards away where a crash could have impacted a downtown building or commercial center.

Unlike other costco's that move in to defunked malls and have an external entrance, you must enter the mall to get inside this costco. 

This costco is the one that is closest to my office, so I usually visit it when I need some food for a work party, have a flat and need a tire fixed or when I just get the craving for some samples.

This costco has some items that appeal to the local demographics. there is a wide range of Mexican cheeses available. Also the liquor selection is skewed more to the affordable end of the spectrum.

This is a very unique costco in Arizona for the fact it is in a mall but the actual store is less than my favorite.",review,-wymeGehHwL9ALaE_NFCXA

The owner was kind enough to email me a while back and we discussed what it was I was unhappy with, he gave me some recommendations based on my tastes, and he sent me a gift certificate to try them out again.  This time around, instead of a dismal one star rating, I find myself wavering between 3 and 4.  I will clarify that I would like to give this place 3.5 but I am rounding up because I have never had chicken as juicy as I did the other night in my entire life.

The husband and I stopped by here right after work, at about 4, and there were a handful of tables already full.  As the time progressed, it became much busier.  I would also like to report that the strong artificial cherry port-a-potty smell I picked up on last time is no longer there.  All I smelled was the food.  We seated ourselves, I glanced over the menu, and I knew what I was going to order.  Thanks to reviews from nathan and Amber, I ordered the quesapilla as an app, and for my entree, I went with the Baja Chicken Burro per the owner's suggestion.

The Quesapilla came out quickly and was already oozing cheese.  I cut it open to share and I couldn't help but stare and watch the cheese slowly fall out.  It was like porn to me.  I have an addiction to food porn.  The taste of it was fantastic.  The cheese tasted great and the crispy/soft shell around it was very nice.  The Baja Chicken Burro (a chicken burrito deep fried and then baked, then topped with cheese and cream cheese sauce) was delicious.  The outside was perfectly crisp, there was just enough cheese, and the cream cheese sauce was perfect!  I was nervous about the sauce because I am not the biggest fan of cream cheese, but this was really great.  It was slightly spicy with a really nice cooling effect because of the dairy.  The chicken was incredible.  It was so juicy and so flavorful I thought I might have a foodgasm.  I can't believe I am saying that about Mexican food, but it's true.  They know their chicken.

Overall, the food was fantastic, much better this time, but the service was okay.  It started off really strong with our drinks coming immediately after we ordered them, and subsequently our food, but after we finished we were left waiting about 20 or so minutes just to get our check.  I also couldn't help but notice while we were waiting, that this place seems to be so friendly.  The owner knew so many of the customers by name and was genuinely interested in their lives.  It was refreshing to see that kind of friendliness.  I take back my original review, it was very clearly an off day.  My husband and I very much enjoyed our food this time around.  Next time I have a taste for Mexican food (probably next cinco de mayo week) I will think about stopping by again.",review,cVejKU_SrdbvzIbQ4oPV0A

You can even hit up several traditional mall stores, but manage to run in and out much quicker than at the traditional malls.

AMBIANCE - 5 stars
In a historic house with both indoor and outdoor seating, this is an amazing atmosphere; better than most of the strip malls that the valley is known for!

SERVICE - 4 stars
The hostess went above and beyond by moving us from an inside table to an outside table by the fire when we had a change of heart and wanted some fresh air.  They also went above and beyond to help me find a parking spot as I didn't want my car to get towed from the lot next door like Patti B. yelped about previously.  Larissa was our server and she was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  There was only one thing that was a bit disappointing when it came to service:  that she came by to take our order and I told her I needed a minute and she said she'd be right back but disappeared for around 10 or 15 minutes.

FOOD - 2.5 stars
Let me explain:  I chose wrong.  Do not order the Seafood Pistou.  Larissa told me that it was a 'messy' dish, but not minding that, I ordered it anyways.  It was not messy, it was just kind of gross.  The seafood didn't taste so fresh and I think the combo of that and the creamy heavy sauce were what gave me a horrible stomach ache that evening.  However, Kristin C. chose right - she had the Ahi Tuna... it was a beautiful presentation and according to Kristin, it was fantastic!  Note to self:  order Ahi if I ever return!  Oh, and I tasted the Asian Pear Salad too - it was tasty.  So, the 2.5 star rating is an average... 

COMPANY - 5 stars!
I'm going to allow the fact that I had a really fun dining companion bring up the average a bit here...

BANG FOR YOUR BUCK- 2 stars
We had only water and perrier to drink and our bill was still kind of high for what I thought was just an ok meal... essentially 1 salad, 2 entrees, and 1 Perrier was over $80 out the door!

07/16/11

Arrived before a friend did, was seated at a two-top, and I was handed a dinner menu.  Had to ask for the Yelp Eats menu (oddity #1 as all the other restaurants I've visited since the start of it all had hosts/servers deliver them w/ the YE menu on the very top of the pile), and when the host handed it over, I noticed a sticker that asked not to share dishes- oddity #2.  As I waited for Linda to arrive, I ordered a mojito ($7.50) and asked server Ana about certain dishes, and she demonstrated great knowledge of both food and beverage menus (kudos to Ana!).  The wonderful mojito (dark rum, fresh lime, muddled mint, sugar, and a ""splash of soda"") arrived just as L. arrived, and, having had their mojitos in the past, she also ordered one for herself.  (If you do not come to dine here, you should at least try their mojito... probably the best I've ever tried, besides the ones I've made!  Not very sweet, the rum not overpower, but still a potent cocktail.)  

After a little chat, we placed our order (split checks) for the Bistec Encevollado (steak w/ onions, for me) and the Frituras de Frijoles Negros (black bean fritters w/ avocado dip, for her).  Despite my preface of ""I'm going to skip on the apps and order an entree, because I want to have dessert later,"" Ana asked me AT LEAST two times ""And what would you like for an appetizer?""  She even pointed to the app portion of the menu the second time, and again I said I was only going to order the entree as I'd wanted to leave room for dessert.  L. was going to start w/ an app first and see if she was going to order more later.  Again, Ana asked what she'd like for an entree, and when Ana left, we already felt like we were being treated rudely and pressured to order more.  (L. eventually ordered another app, and then a dessert.)  App and steak arrived together, and for the record, I offered L. a taste of the wonderful steak, and she turned it down, bec. she tries not to eat too much red meat, but she did try the Papas de la Casa (spicy homestyle potatoes) and found them very salty.  I described the side dish as ""highly-seasoned.""  Yes, they were very salty, and I hadn't noticed they were spicy, but Mom did when she tried a little bit at home.  L. tried to share her fritters w/ me, but I've already tried them before, and I wanted to concentrate on the steak.  It was a ""good"" thing that Ana had pressured L. to order a second dish, bec. she actually ended up liking the Frituras de Camarones (three crispy shrimp pancakes served w/ a Romesco sauce).  (Hey!  I was correct when I thought the sauce looked like it was thickened w/ some sort of nuts... friend described it having a flavor she couldn't put a finger on, aside from the pepperiness and acidity... it also contained almonds and sherry.)  I very much enjoyed the Bistec encevollado and would not hesitate to order it again!

Ana had asked a couple of times if I was ready to order dessert, but I decided to wait for L. to finish eating.  I was still enjoying my mojito and was even contemplating on having another.  (Actually, I was stalling for time since I couldn't decide whether I was going to order the chocolate bread pudding w/ homemade dark fudge rum sauce, or the lime pie!)  Finally, I decided to order, and I chose the bread pudding and asked L. if she'd get the lime pie, and she said yes.  Score!  While I enjoyed both desserts (I'd had two ""tastes"" of the pie before I asked for one ""to-go""), I favored the pie.  That night, however, I couldn't get enough of the fudge rum sauce!!  I tell ya, I don't know what I WOULDN'T do to have another chance at savoring this fudge sauce again.  ;)  As far as the lime pie is concerned, I don't know how Linda could sit there and watch me take three swipes off of her pie... I think I was only able to restrain myself from having more, bec. I knew I'd have another one to enjoy at home!  Oh yeah, take the bread pudding (but leave the rum sauce!), and I'll have the lime pie every time from now on!

We plan on visiting again, esp. on Mojito Mondays ($3 mojitos all day), and we hope that the rudeness was only due to Yelp Eats Week (although there really isn't an excuse for the rudeness!), bec. it would be a shame to have to skip this HC location-- L. said that this location is less noisy than that on Camelback.  I probably should not have tipped 20% off of the original cost of the my bill (original would've been $40.50, plus tax, and w/ the YE discount, a total of $27, w/ tax), since she was so rude to us, but I didn't want her to think that Yelpers were cheapskates.  

p.s.  Almost forgot to mention, upon entry to this location, I couldn't help but noticing that the restaurant smelled strongly of body odor!  (Onions.)  If I wasn't meeting a friend here, I might've walked out and gone somewhere else.

FOOD
--------
Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.

Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the ""little ear"" pasta and ""alla puttanesca"" means it's made ""whore style"". 

And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.

The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. 

And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.

As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, ""oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this."" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. 

SERVICE
-------------
Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. 

And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. 

SETTING

I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. 

The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. 

I definitely don't think this is going to be as ""scene-y"" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. 

EXTRA CRIB NOTES
-----------------------------
* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.
* It's great
* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.
* it's great
* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). 
* it's great
* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.
* it's great
* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?
* did I tell you it's great?

ALL IN ALL
---------------
An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. 

I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.

And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)...",review,r3r_bAfa6pZKIhQB82FizQ

We've been to Turf half a dozen times and usually it is the price-point that keeps me from wandering to the back of the complex and trying Pasta Bar.  I finally got my mother to take us out so that I didn't have to pay for it.  

Pasta Bar seems to have the worst location of the three restaurants in the complex.  There is no patio, no windows, and no personality.  It is too bad because Italian places are always begging for style.  A mirror, a few paintings, some duct work, and a nicely-crafted bar sort of make up the entire ambiance of  PB.

The place was dead when we got there.  It was Saturday afternoon and Turf seemed to be pretty busy.  The waitress was helpful and informative when we got in and we looked over the lunch menu.  They had a lunch special where you picked lemonade or tea, got a salad, and a different type of cavatelli.  I had lemonade and the pesto pasta.  

The lemonade was the most sour thing I had ever drank.  In fact, I think it was made of liquefied lemon Warheads.  No amount of sugar was going to make this drinkable.  It was pretty disappointing.  

As far as the breadstick thing goes, they were fine.  I think I would rather them bring out a basket of breadsticks instead of them sitting on the table like a package of chopsticks.  They taste fine.

My pasta really wasn't that great.  The pesto was nice and light, which was a bit surprising.  It tasted good but could have had more garlic.  The pasta, however, was undercooked and rubbery.  I love non-flour pasta and I will almost always order gnocci or cavatelli if they are available and this was simply not that great.  It was fine but could have been better.

The salad was actually worse than the salad that comes with the Fez Burger.  I didn't think such a thing was possible, but Pasta Bar has figured out how to make it.  They apparently take an entire stalk of celery and chop it up and throw it in with 5 pieces of lettuce and an orange tomato.  The celery taste was so overwhelming that I couldn't possible eat more than two bites of it.  That's fine, I don't go to a pasta place for the salad, but I would have been fine with a traditional salad.

In all, the lunch special for $12 is a fine deal.  The pasta is decent.  My mother had the other cavatelli (with the pomodoro sauce).  It was much better than mine.  I can't give this place a bad review but I would probably not go back.  With so many other food options next door or just down the rail/street, it is hard to see myself going back.",review,r3r_bAfa6pZKIhQB82FizQ

This is certainly not the case I realized upon entering.  It is just a sandwich place that also sells a bunch of random bric-a-brac.  It is all basically picnic stuff I think.  I dunno...it was real difficult to get a feel for the place.  It was all pretty random to me.  But anyway, about the food....

I ordered ""The Duckling"" sandwich was is one of their ""signature sandwiches"".  It seemed like a good selection because the name of the sandwich and the sandwich itself had duck in it and so does the name of the restaurant.  However, the sandwich was just ok.  Nothing special.  Not worth 9 bucks.  just a few slices of meat in between 2 pieces of bread.

All the sandwiches on the menu did however look interesting.  They are definitely not your typical ""sandwich place"" type sandwiches.  Well some of them are but they all have that special Duck & Decanter twist.  The have some deli type sandwich selections as well but I would prefer to just go to a deli for those.

My wife ordered the chicken salad and it was very very good.  I would order it if I ever visit the place again.  She ordered the Sonoran with spicy oil & vinegar.  It was very tasty and no mayo or any of the bad stuff.

The service was very friendly but I took a long while to get our sandwiches.  There must have been a large order ahead of us or something because there weren't many people in the place.  I couldn't imagine going here on a weekday during the  lunch rush because the line would likely be out the door and would take forever to get your food.

Anyway, after a few months of running in old shoes my wife talked me into going here and getting ""real"" running shoes and not just whatever sneakers were on sale at the mall.  I was afraid I would be talked into a $200 pair by some salesperson who would make me think they would enable me to run for forever without getting tired.  However, this was not the case at all.  Our guy there, Brandon, analyzed my running on their treadmill thing and recommended some very reasonable kicks.  They were like $50 or something.  They lasted for like a year and I just went back to see Brandon last weekend to get something new.  Again he recommended a very good pair that I love so far.  They were pretty inexpensive as well. 

Right when you walk in the door you will probably be greeted by an overly friendly associate like the moment you step out of your car at a car dealership.  He/she will then try to answer your questions or give you to an employee that works in the particular department of the gear you are looking to purchase.  However, if you are just browsing somebody will probably come up to you every 2 minutes to ask if you need any assistance.  Anyway, aside from that, it is a pretty good shopping experience.  It also looks like they have some pretty sweet deals and sales if you are part of their ""club"".  A member of my family is so I use his discount which is usually pretty substantial so if you are a mildly serious runner then I would spring the few bucks to become a member.

Their selection of running stuffs seems to be pretty large and comprehensive.  I can't think of anything else I would ever need to run.  Looks like there is some pretty advanced stuff there but I doubt I'll ever get to the point of actually needing it.

I do however like the open kitchen so you can see how they cook everything.  Everyone who works there is very friendly and pretty speedy with everything.

Everything looked to be cooked fresh to order and our entire order was out in well under 10 minutes.

* American Salad = very good but nothing very special.
* Green Chili Burger = eh.  Sounds better than it is.  The meat is ok I guess but I didn't like the bun because it was too dry or something.  The ""sweet jalapenos"" had an ok spice to it but I couldn't really tell if they were sweet or not.  The green chili looked to be from a can.  There really wasn't too much going on in the way of flavor for this burger.
* Regular Fries = very good.  Perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  They were also perfectly salted and not too greasy.
* Sweet Potato Fries = these were very good as well.
* Soda fountain = very unique.  Not your typical Coke/Pepsi type machine.  Everything is a brand I never heard of before and uses pure cane sugar for the soda instead of chemicals (except for their diet stuff).  The sodas were pretty good but a tad to sweet for me.

I don't even remember if he was open for dinner, but damn we used to go 2-3 time a week for lunch. 

So flash forward to when Jerry Colangelo coaxed him into moving downtown, as part of Jerry's dreams of a DisneyLand downtown.

The last time I went was just before the Oprah/Martha Stewart mess, and at 9:45 only waited 40 minutes for a table. People wait longer at Oregano's. This is no longer possible though as half the time they cut off the names at 8-9pm if they realize they are going to be there to 1am to accommodate everyone.

Even with the awesome food, and fun ambiance, is it worth the wait?

Monte Carlo has never lost or ruined a garment, and anytime I've showed them a stain, it was cleanly removed.  The price is on par with most dry cleaners in the valley.  It's actually very good when compared to much of the competition in the immediate area.

It's a little annoying that they don't take credit cards, but that seems to be a very common trend in the dry cleaning business.",review,cAhn-O2kSI0BNPSCDKdNTQ

The food was fantastic but very small portions so we did end up ordering chips with salsa and guacamole on top of it.  The tapas trio was served on a wrought iron ""tree"" which makes for a beautiful presentation.  But you can see from the pics that it really only feeds one person unless you are planning to have dinner afterwards.  All the food was delicious but at the end of the night we spent almost $60 for two and still left hungry.

Of course, that was really my fault since I am a sucker for those high-priced specialty cocktails. Those went down a little too easy at $12-$14 a pop. I highly recommend the one with grapefruit and basil.  It was truly amazing.  Very tasty and fresh but not too sweet.  I also tried the one made with gin and chambord which I did not like as much as I thought would but it was made by the other bartender and I think that had something to do with it.  Unfortunately, I didn't catch either of their names so I am no help there.  But when you go, look for a woman at the bar with the long, sandy blond pony tail 'cause she rocks!  I probably should have just stuck to beer like my husband since those were only $4. Which is not bad considering they had a great selection, though unfortunately everything was bottled, no taps.  They had the usual higher end stuff like Stella, Guinness, and New Belgium. Plus some awesome local beers like Four Peaks (Kiltlifter and 8th St ale), San Tan (Epicenter and hefeweizen) and Nimbus (ipa).

She also provided me with a small sandwich style container for putting in veggies from the salsa bar and said if i needed another to just ask. I helped myself to the fresh sliced cucumbers, radishes, cabbage, wedges of key lime and pickled onions on the bar and filled a few small cups of salsa. The red was spicy with a vinegar base. The green was quite tasty as was the pico de gallo. 
The birria came with corn tortillas and small containers of fresh onion and cilantro. Again this was served as a caldo (sans veggies) but that is what you toss in the onions, cilantro, lime juice and some salsa. Yum! 

The torta was huge. Warning it doesn't come dressed. I was expecting the mayo, avocado, tomato to already be on this. But luckily I had picked up all the fixings at the salsa bar to make it work.

I've had Tortas El Guero bookmarked for a couple of weeks when a friend told me of the wonderful torta she had here recently, I thought I'd visit it on my next days off.  Came in prior to 430p, and the woman manning the counter could not speak any English at all.  Good thing I still retained a little of basic Spanish to request that a few ingredients be omitted.  (Had I waited till 5p, I'd have no problem w/ the bilingual Caucasian server that arrived.)  

Chose the carne asada torta, and the bread was good.  However, the filling was very sparse.  I suggest that TEG either use smaller-sized bread, or up the filling a bit!  The cost of the sandwich is definitely too high-- I wouldn't order this same sandwich for that price again (especially when I could order a huge serving that is equally as tasty, perhaps more so, at Phoenix Ranch Market-- the telera bread there is amazing!).  Indeed, I had to order two side tacos for their meat contents (pastor y carne asada) to be able to fill in the rest of the torta :(  Based on what I tried, if I were to come back, I'd order the pastor.  I don't think I'll be back, though.

We ate family style, so we started with spring rolls, soup and cucumber salad. Each item was tasty but not filling enough so that I didn't want to move on to the next course -- just enough to wet the appetite for more. So on to the next course. For the entree, we had Singapore rice noodles with curry, Chicken and noodles (I think it was called Chicken Chow Fun), the hot and spicy eggplant and a tofu salad plus white and brown rice. Each dish complimented each other and provided a perfect blend of tastes. I enjoyed every bite and couldn't stop eating. It was just too delicious. Of everything, my favorites were the chicken noodle dish, the shrimp curry and the eggplant. I loved the arrangement of spices. Each bite hit a different part of my taste buds. 

The decor of Tottie's is filled with authentic character true to the cuisine. If I didn't know better, if I closed my eyes I could just as easily  be in a SF restaurant. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. It has the true feel of a neighborhood restaurant and I got the sense that those who visit a lot are probably known by name. But for those newbies like myself, they still made me feel at home and as if I'd been coming there for years!

To end the amazing meal, we tried the Fried Honey Banana. It was a perfectly sized dessert to share with four and incredibly sweet so you could have a taste and be completely satisfied. And what's an Asian Fusion meal without a fortune cookie! So I opened my fortune cookie expecting some random sentence that didn't really make much since. But instead, my fortune read: ""You will be recognized and honored as a community leader."" Ok Tottie. I'll take that! Finally a fortune that makes some sense. :)

Joanne's is great, but somewhat different than this place in that she brings out dishes specially prepared for each dining party, to go with the few items on the Buffet.  Pete's is the same setup as this, but Pink Pepper here offers way more variety in the foods, with 31 main food items, each considerably different than the others.

After poring over the dosa menu, I finally decided on the Udupi Special spring dosa, a version I haven't tried here before.  I asked my servers if the dosa and the chutneys were free of certain allergenic ingredients and was told, with authority I might add, that the dosa was OK and while two of three chutneys [coconut and jalapeno-cilantro (?)] were off-limits, the sambar is good-to-go.  (He even pointed out an allergen ingredient in the coconut chutney.)  The A-OK signal on the sambar surprised me greatly, as out of the three choices, it was the first item I'd have balked at trying (I've tried it at many other restaurants and was told that the recipe calls for a few allergens).  My server did offer to bring tamarind sauce to replace the other two chutneys.  Since I was almost salivating at the sight of the dosa and the server was pretty confident in his knowledge of chutney ingredients, I dove my spoon into the sambar and came up with a lovely and flavorful chunk of potato and a bit of broth.  Yum!  I went in again, this time swirling a bit to make sure there weren't any allergens hiding in the murky depths when I spotted *!  As if on cue, my server AND the host approach my table to tell me that I should not eat the sambar nor the dosa since they contained allergens.  Argh!  So, away went my Udupi special spring dosa, away went the sambar, and I was back to square one as to what to order, although this time I knew I had a few hours of pain and nausea to look forward to (which started to rear their ugly heads as I was signing my credit card receipt).

At this point, the host was steering me away from the dosa menu since I'd have to stay away from all that contained any filling (apparently, the kitchen staff could not whip up a filling that omitted the one ingredient that kept me from having it).  Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be such a terrible thing as there are many other dosa options that would then be complemented with chutneys, but since the three chutneys also contained an ingredient I couldn't have (again, the chef would not be able to make the sauces omitting the ingredient- the host explained that the chutneys were made in huge batches earlier in the day), dosa from Udupi Cafe is off-limits for me :(  I decided, then, to have the assorted appetizer platter.  This would've only been accompanied by tamarind sauce had I not asked for a second option, plain yogurt, as suggested by the host.  ""Plain yogurt?,"" I asked.  ""Could you add something else to flavor the yogurt?""  ""Carrots.  Is carrots OK?,"" the host posited.  ""Yes, carrots are alright,"" I said.  

The three items I savored in the app platter were cauliflower pakora, the samosa, and the veggie cutlet^.  I wasn't a fan of the dense mysore bonda (various fillings of potato, eggplant, and jalapeno) nor the bready medhu vada (fried lentil donuts), although the latter was quite good dipped in tamarind sauce AND yogurt.  In retrospect, I did not particularly revel in the recurring reminders of how everything was deep-fried :(

In light of the disinclination of Udupi Cafe to omit certain ingredients in their dishes- which leads me to believe that most items are already pre-made and later plated (if you read my other reviews, you'll see just how many chefs are quite willing to swap out/sub sauces, sometimes PIQUED at the chance to come up with a new sauce on-the-fly) and the the reluctance in creating a simple chutney, I doubt I'll keep UC at the top of my choices next time I have a taste for Indian cuisine.  So many fish in the sea...  

I wish UC and its management and staff well in providing vegetarians and omnivores alike the opportunity to enjoy a menu offering up 100% veggie fare.  Do try the Gobi Manchurian- very tasty!

The meat was very tender and flavorful.

The chicken fried steak was very good, with tender pounded beef and crispy breading.  There were 2 giant pieces on the platter, and it was topped with a generous amount of gravy.

We started with calamari and ordered the crab raviolis and shrimp risotto for dinner. When I was ordering my meal, the waiter asked me whether I wanted a house or Caesar salad. The way he said it gave the impression that a salad was included in the meal. However, something didn't seem right since it didn't indicate that on the menu, so I awkwardly asked. He then quietly answered me saying no, a salad wasn't included.

I would have been pretty unhappily surprised when the bill came if I hadn't caught on when I ordered.

Spicy and full of flavor, I just couldn't get enough of what the French Quarter, Marigny, and the Garden District had to offer. And the beignets. Oh, those fickin' beignets.  I'm salivating right now just thinking about them.

And so, when the opportunity arose not too long ago to dine at Baby Kay's in the awesome and happening Town & Country shopping center, I jumped right on it, hanging out with a fellow Yelper on the patio with the other office-type folk.

FOOD
---------
Over hushpuppies, gumbo, and etoufee, I sat there pondering about what I was eating. It had been quite a while since I'd last eaten here, but everything seemed oddly familiar in that nothing really stood out for me. I then said to my friend, ""Huh. Baby Kay's grub is ok. Not great Cajun, not bad Cajun.  Just not a whole lot for the price, though. If I wrote a Yelp review on it, I'd give it 3 stars.""

And so today I decided to finally do just that.

Except when I logged into Yelp I found out I had already reviewed this place.

And had already given it three stars.

So go figure. At least they're consistent.

3 stars (again).",review,24qSrF_XOrvaHDBy-gLIQg

My increasingly rare visits here just further add to my disappointment.  
I find myself here with family or friends who are still convinced they have to stop in here while in the Valley.  

I have no issue with the environment or the service. What I do have an issue with is the food quality.  Unless you like your seafood fried or are just here for some apps and drinks, there are better places in the Valley for seafood for the price.  Although, I wouldn't get the occasional employee flash mob dance routine. 
 
My last trip here I ordered one of their steamer pots with the seafood, corn on the cob, potatos and a sausage.  The pot I chose had crab and shrimp. The crab was meh and the steamed shrimp were super over cooked.  I could do better at the frozen food section at the local grocery.

I think they've been open for a couple of months - for breakfast and lunch.  They offer a full bar so I'm sure they will open soon for dinner too.

I've been here on several occasions and I think the food is actually pretty consistent with their other location (44th street and Camelback).  Service is pretty quick and attentive.  I recommend their passion fruit iced tea if you're an iced tea fan.  I also recommend their tuna salad - it's made with non-fat yogurt and water chestnuts.  (I know it sounds weird but it's really really good).  I get their tuna salad sandwich in a whole wheat wrap.  It comes with tomato, lettuce and avocado and your choice of sweet potato fries, fruit, or mixed green salad.  It's all really really good.  If that doesn't sound appealing, there is for sure something else on the menu for you - breakfast is served until 3pm i think and there are tons of salads, sandwiches, and much more to choose from.

Yes, it's in a strip mall, but isn't everything in Scottsdale in strip malls nowadays?  I guess I'm used to that.  This location seems like a good place to go with a group.  I would call ahead if you do so (even though it's never been too crowded when I've been).

I was with my BF; we were downtown and it looked like it wasn't too crowded, so we parked and went inside.

This place has character!  It reminded us a bit of the original Pita Jungle in Tempe... artwork on the walls and a hipster crowd.  Lots of healthy options on the menu and a nice selection of beer as well.  We both ordered the vegetarian wrap sandwich.  It comes with your choice of orzo or chips.  I read 'Terra Chips' somewhere on the menu, and since I love Terra Chips, I went with the chips.  Jared went with the orzo salad.  Our service was quick and attentive, and we both enjoyed our sandwiches... not quite as good as Pita Jungle, but pretty good.  I was disappointed that the 'chips' my sandwich came with were just plain potato chips, not Terra Chips.  Jared seemed to enjoy his orzo salad.

The menu is huge, and this is just the menu for the gringos. If you know Chinese there is a whole menu of family meals that you can order from. 

There are many vegetarian dishes not just the usual tofu and veggies, they have a large selection of exotic mushroom and veggie dishes.

I had the golden mushrooms with tofu $7.99 a house specialty. Mitake mushrooms a light brown sauce and huge pillow of soft fried tofu. It was nice ans somewhat light

We also had the black mushrooms with Chinese greens. $9.99 This dish had a very earthy taste and the greens were very fresh but hard to eat with chopsticks.

Another great dish was the veggie hotpot that had some really interesting textures along with the noodles and veggies. 

Service was a bit lack luster, but maybe that was due to the wedding in the other side.

It's in an outdoor mall, like everything else.  We were starving and the entire mall was DEAD.  It looked like places were closed, so we went to Margaritaville for lunch.
Main entrance isn't clearly marked and we went in through the patio area.  Walked in and didn't see a reception area.  So, we asked the nearest waitress if we were to seat ourselves.  She said in her best airline stewardess voice ""Ovah they-ah is where you check-in.""  It was fake and annoying.  So, we go check in.  15 minute-wait for 2 people.  The place was crowded, but we had passed a few empty tables along the way.  My mom even pointed it out.  ""Our kitchen is pretty backed-up, so we can't seat all tables right now.""  Keep in mind this was at 12:30 on a Saturday afternoon.  Wouldn't this be the time to make sure you know to have enough kitchen staff on hand???
We meandered to the bar, which was empty except for 2 people.  We sat at the corner and, luckily, found out we could eat there.  The bartender was the first friendly person we came across, and I'm glad SHE got a tip from us.  Service was quick.  Our food came out within 10 minutes.  
Mom got the chicken quesadilla, I got the taco salad.  I couldn't believe how FEW items were on the menu.  I was expecting a bit more.

It can get somewhat crowded and you'll find more elbow room outside on the expansive patio, but I've never seen it wall-to-wall people. This is pretty much a well-known fixture of downtown Tempe and it's frequented by all sorts of artsy cool-type people. It's not your typical college bar. It's also not really some sort of locals-only club. 

I tend to get tired of going there easily because my friends who consider themselves too cool for Scottsdale always mention either that or Bikini Lounge or some other Central Phoenix hipster dive. I also find that most people are much younger than me... it's not as bad as a lot of bars near the campus, but it's still pretty obvious. That could just be that I'm getting too old to go out though. Perhaps I should just stay inside. 

I mean, I agree with my friends who think Scottsdale is full of douchebags, but I staunchly disagree with their belief that there's nowhere cool to go in Scottsdale. Scottsdale is littered with awesome non-douchebag places to go. I guess that's beside the point... almost... I guess I just think that a lot of people from Phoenix and Tempe see Scottsdale as being full of snobs (Snobbsdale) apart from the douchebaggy scene. It seems like they are always saying how lame Scottsdale is because everyone sucks and blah blah, but that kind of attitude just sounds to me like reverse snobbery. Like ""I'm too cool to hang in Scottsdale... "" Whatever.

So Casey Moore's - it's basically an old reliable pub. Not the easiest place to get a drink at, but it's a cool place to chill and drink and talk with friends without having to yell over techno beats or top 40 hits. The upstairs is supposedly haunted and the owners are constantly pissing off the neighborhood residents because it's hard to find parking and people are noisy on the patio. Shit, I just realized someone else described the patio as ""expansive"" also - well, whatever - it is.

I remember thinking how cool it was to take the escalator up to the movie theater.  So here's where we are now.

Really good things:
 - Where else are you going to shop?  There is SO little good shopping when you live in/near this area.
 - There is a Costco.  This brings up the status level of just about anywhere, let's be honest.  This was my MAIN Costco for a long time.  
 - The Chinese food restaurant is pretty cool.
 - I love the old school deli!  It totally feels 1975 when I go there.
 - They haven't tried to overly modernize.  Sound like a dubious ""good thing"" but I love the old school brick work walk ways and planters.  
 - New shops like Ross and Petsmart have really helped the place!

Not so good things:
 - This was the nastiest Wal-Mart I've ever been in. I'm already not a Wal-Mart fan, but there were a few times when I needed something fast and well, it was there.  Walking through there during Christmas for freaking ornament hangers was one of my worst experiences ever.
 - Can you call this a food court?  It's almost hidden and for good reason.  There aren't many reasons to eat there, and there are many reasons not to.

I say that so you'll understand that Cowboy Ciao is also a great option for mid-day dining. Of course I want to go back for dinner and check out that menu, but all in good time...

For lunch, my hungry co-workers and I decided Cowboy Ciao was a fantastic Plan B (After Geisha so rudely dismissed us). Some of us were concerned about the price, but I figured I'd enjoy my lunch, no matter the cost, since it wasn't everyday that I get to dine at such well-received places. 

I ordered the Buffalo Carpaccio. It was on their ""light"" menu, with plates to share or options that won't leave you feeling overly stuffed. It was actually quite filling, with thin slices of seared buffalo, generous portions of goat cheese, a small green salad with beets and dried pieces of garlic bread (think upscale croutons). I loved everything but the dried bread. Oh well. It was soooo good, especially when combining the buffalo, goat cheese and green in a fork-full bite of pure enjoyment. 

My friend got the famous (or infamous) Stetson Chopped Salad. Imagine my surprise when it was smoked salmon as the main meat - not beef, as I expected. Then again, when I think cowboy + stetson, I think beef. Wouldn't you? Turns out the salad isn't named in the cowboy theme (which is tastefully displayed in the decor) but for the name of the street. Ah-ha! Clever, Cowboy Ciao. You got me there. 

Anyhow, the salad, though small for a hungry luncher, was beautiful presented - all ingredients lined up in rows, then ""chopped"" right before your eyes! My co-worker was a bit disapponted in the size of the salad for $12. It's definitely not something you should order if you're really hungry!

My other co-worker ordered the daily special - an ENORMOUS sandwich that consisted of bacon, avocado, tomatoes, rooster (i forget the ""special culinary name"" for this) and toasted ciabatta bread. It was HUGE. Definitely a bargain for $10. I heard it was damn good, too. 

I also had a cup of their coffee. Yum. With fresh cream. I noticed it was a $3.00 cup, though. Dang. Next time I will accept the offer for a re-fill! 

Soooo... what's the verdict? Cowboy Ciao gets my seal of approval. It's a great place for lunch, especially if you decide to split a couple ""light"" plates. You may even opt for desert. How can you miss the delectable temptations, when they're the first thing on the menu you see? 

Cowboy Ciao, I'm on to you. You want me to be one of the many customers leaving behind witty remarks, don't you? You want me doing back-flips like an Olympic gymnast on my way out the door? Well, like I said, I'm on to you. But don't worry. It's a good thing. You definitely won me over, especially since, with tip, I was able to have a wonderful, satisfying lunch here for $20.

My first impressions were that this was a very cute little restaurant with homey touches here and there but not without it's own modern flair.  The tables and chairs are all mismatched, but thankfully at appropriate heights.  I liked the faux ceiling that gave the impression that it was lower in the middle, but I can see other people really hating that.  The staff was all friendly and knowledgeable and the guy who I am guessing is the owner had some really amusing shorts on.

The food was wonderful.  There was lots that looked good on the menu to us, and it was too difficult to narrow it down to one sharing plate, on top of the appetizer and small plate we ordered, so we went ahead and got two.  We started with the walnut crusted fontina, and that was delicious.  It was served with a sweet and earthy pear sauce as well as a roasted red pepper sauce.  They were delicious when swirled together.  Next we had the mac and cheese with the lobstah added.  I really liked the mac and cheese.  It was tender with a real down home sauce with just the right amount of cheesy flavor and warmth.  The lobster was quite unique.  It had a great woody flavor that I didn't expect but I found to be really appropriate for the dish.  Finally, I had the citrus brined fried chicken and white cheddar waffle.  It was ambrosial.  The chicken was the best fried chicken I have ever had.  It was intensely crispy and the citrus brine gave it a whole new flavor profile that I was not ready for.

Open since 1965, The Original Wineburger in Phoenix hits high marks when it comes dive hangouts, but most of all, they make one killer burger.

Walking into Wineburger, you'll feel as if you've been transported to another place and time, and this is a good thing. Surrounded by wood paneling, Formica-topped tables and the glow of neon beer signs, the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed. Diners seat themselves in either the main bar area or the game area.

A burger joint doesn't bring visions of healthy light snack and salads; let's face it, you're here to eat thick slabs of meat and fried accompaniments. So it's no surprise the menu is full of fried delights, like the tasty Mini Corn Dogs ($4.75), finger-sized corn dogs that were fresh and hot.

I also enjoyed the Cheddar Pints ($5), battered cheese curds deep fried to a golden brown perfection, a Wisconsin favorite.

When it comes to burgers, the Original Wineburger's fanciest ingredient is a splash of sangria to help enhance the beef's natural flavor and juiciness. The Original Wineburger ($5.75), one-third pound of certified Angus Beef, was cooked perfectly medium and oozing with cheddar cheese. Each juicy bite was hinted with wine, which gave the burger a slightly sweet edge.

The Super Wineburger ($8.75) is a two-third pound version of the original, though after a few bites I realized that they forgot to use wine on this one. The bacon I added to my burger provided a fair amount of porky smokiness.

What's a tasty burger without a tasty beer? Complimenting the salty beefiness, Moose Drool Brown Ale ($3.50) was ice cold and had a sweet malty flavor. Surprisingly light for a brown ale, it was a pleasure drinking. While the Trout Slayer Filtered Wheat Beer ($3.50) was slightly bitter at first, it mellowed into a sweet smoothness that sort of reminded me of an apple.

The mista consisted of mixed greens, tomato wedges, crunchy walnuts, feta, and Florencia's fantastic balsamic vinaigrette.  (You can purchase the vinaigrette to take home!)  This salad was so delicious and so much fun to eat (crunchy walnuts, creamy feta, and tangy vinaigrette were the secrets to this simple, yet delightful salad!), I could see myself coming back and ordering a small order for my main meal and be completely satisfied.

Now Scottsdale and the rest of the Valley are not lacking in sushi restaurants - especially  trendy sceney places.  Yawn.  In fact, I found there to be more sushi bars than I expected for our desert outpost.  But what separates one from the others are: good food, fresh fish, good service, good value.  And this place def does it right...

Plus it's the only place I know of (can anyone help me out here?) in the area where I can find the holy grail of all sushi - the rich, but-gusting, let-me-workout-before-I-eat-this baked scallop roll.  Now, let me explain.   In ""Sushi Heaven"" (otherwise known to laymen as Ventura Blvd. in L.A.) there is this place that serves this and is known for this tasty delicacy.  But I have yet to find a place that serves the baked scallop roll (basically a california roll covered in warmed baked scallops), but along came Sakana. 

Prices are reasonable, the decor is a happy medium - not too trendy, not too drab.  I never have to wait here - but always find myself waiting when I go to RA.  Whatever.  Something is wrong with that picture...

The crowd ranges the spectrum from older couples, families with kids, younger couples, and friends catching up after work.  I hear there are other locations throughout the Valley, but this is the one I frequent.   Another bonus for this place is the location away from Old Town Scottsdale and the parking headaches there.

The thin crust pizzas are actually really good, but light, so if you have a serious appetite don't be surprised if it don't need a box to take home extra slices. The house pizzas have interesting topping blends like artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes (err . . . maybe that's not that interesting. What can I say? I like heavy things with meat on them that you can empty entire jars of parmesan cheese onto. Any deviation from dense cheese and meat is ""interesting"" to me).

It's hung up on the wall next to other things, like posters with catchy phrases and local acknowledgments of Hap's being the best BBQ around town. 

This place is really just a hop, skip and jump from my office. On a rainy November day, BBQ sounds superb. So, I hop, skip and jump over to Hap's. It's my first time and I'm curious to see how they do BBQ. After all, I hail from the south, you could say, and have eaten some pretty great BBQ in Oklahoma and Texas. 

At Hap's around 12 on a Friday, there's a line out the door. I agree to wait. The wait allows me to check out the decor and patrons. It's mostly men here, and I begin to think, ""What a meat market."" Literally, with pulled pork, lamb, chicken, ham and links as your choices. But, all I see when I look around are young and middle aged men. Some are rather cute. Who knew such things existed in this business area off Washington and 48th St. 

I'm not the only one with wandering eyes. I notice several of the patrons take notice of me, the only young female in the place. Yep, that's right. I'm here for the BBQ. 

The menu is a bit cumbersome to read. There's the regular menu and a catering one. Then there's a small black board with suggested specials. I jump at the chance to try their smoked BBQ lamb with their mint dressing on the side. Mint isn't the only dressing option you have, but it sounded like the ideal match for lamb - even the little black board said so. 

So, it's my turn at the register. The woman behind the counter gives me a big, friendly smile. I smile back. ""I'd like to try your smoked lamb sandwich with mint on the side."" I tell her it's to go. She punches up my total - $5.07 - runs my card and hands me a receipt. She also asks for my name, for when you place an order here and it's ready, they shout out your name. Not some number. Not profanity. Your name. Very cool. Well, they didn't have a chance to shout my name. While the woman hands me my receipt copy and card, a man leans over the counter. ""Alicia?"" Yep. ""Here you go. Enjoy."" I didn't even have to wait one millisecond. I snatch up the bag and left. It's not that I wanted to eat there, but if I had, there wouldn't have been any open booths anyway - just a couple of stools against the wall, nearly in the way of the line of hungry lunchers. 

I anticipate biting into the sandwich and having an ""oohhh"" moment. The sandwich is sloppy, pieces of lamp escaping the entrapment of the bun. I dunk the lamb pieces in the mint dressing, which is my favorite part of the sandwich. Don't get me wrong, the meat is good. It just didn't wow me. Nor did the bun, which is your basic hamburger bun you can buy at the grocery store. The sauce was also just okay. I mean, I could tell it was BBQ sauce, but, let's face it, it wasn't oh-my-god BBQ sauce. So... 

3 stars for Hap's. I can see why Phoenix likes this place, for it offers up a plethora of BBQ options and sides, including broccoli and cheese casserole. Or, supposedly, they have a really great cauliflower casserole. My friend says so. If that's not your thing, there's bags of chips, cobbler (peach, cherry, etc.), chocolate nut brownies and even coleslaw. 

So, why not a higher rating? Because I wasn't wowed by their translation of BBQ. Granted, I ordered one simple sandwich, but even that one simple sandwich, with all its flavor and sustenance, wasn't enough for me to deem this place my preferred lunch destination. 

Yet, it's definitely worth checking out.

A small, contrived downtown that feels more like an outdoor mall than anything else. I guess this is what ""downtown"" Chandler is all about. 

San Tan Brewing Company has been hyped to me by a couple of people, but their Tuesday night Tasting really caught my eye after it was featured in the Phoenix New Times. My friends and I decided to go and luckily we were one of the first ones to reserve so we got right in. The event was a 6 course tasting menu, with 6 beers, for $25 and I kept thinking WOW! what a value. As the night progressed, I figured out how they were able to serve this menu for $25 and still muster a profit. 

Our first course was actually their Sun Devil Cask Ale, which was a delicious beer for those who like a hoppy and bitter ale. I am a huge fan of Stone's Double Bastard, and Dogfish Head's 120 and 90 minute IPA so this was right up my alley. Our first food course was a spinach salad with chocolate chips, raspberries, and some sort of syrup, yuck! Second course that came out was a date stuffed with chorizo, wrapped in bacon, and it was absolutely delicious. I figured the evening was going to be saved...

When our third course came out, I started getting worried again as it was a buffalo chili with what was supposed to be cornbread in it. I was pretty sure it was a biscuit that came out of a tube... yeah, it was that pathetic. The beer they paired it with, however, I fell in love with. The smoked porter was amazing, to me as I love very peaty scotches. 

So the guy came on the microphone and started explaining that the short rib main course was taking a while because they had been cooking for 14 hours and were falling apart when they were plated. Oh man, I'm really in for a treat now! He gave the story about how they had purchased these the night before from a great meat provider (I didn't know Lee Lee Market was known for high quality meats) and they had been slow cooking ever since. I got even more excited. What was put in front of me though, had to be the most insulting, pathetic excuse for a piece of meat I have seen in my life. I love short ribs like a fat kid loves cake, but I could only muster two bites of mine before finally giving up. Most of those around me were in agreement that it was a bad piece of meat, cooked poorly, and consisted of 75% gristle. I had the ""pleasure"" of sitting across the table from one of their employees who had the ""pleasure"" of annoying me all night. I told him exactly what I thought of the dish, and how he should be embarrassed to work at any place that would serve it to a human being. It was the WORST dish I've had in a long long time. Absolutely vile. 

I have to say the servers were friendly, and the place had a cool vibe and a sweet patio, but the food is just unfathomably awful. I think they are getting by on the culinary ignorance of everyone in Chandler. Put this place downtown or in Scottsdale and they would really have to ramp things up. They did announce that their chef is leaving the restaurant, and maybe I should have kept my mouth shut, but I told them on my way out that they should be excited for the chance to get someone with talent.

The weather was beautiful last night, so thought we would ride the light rail to Tempe and enjoy some drinks and food on a patio.  I've always been intrigued by the Depot Cantina, so that is where we decided to go.  We found a nice table on the patio and we were off to a good start.  But, it all went downhill from there....the service was so terribly slow and she didn't really apologize for it.  It took us 15 minutes to get our drinks and then another 10 to get our food order in...only because I asked another server to help us.  They cranked the music too loud and it caused it to cut in and out.  We told multiple servers multiple times that if they turned the music down it would go back to normal...took 30 minutes for that to be fixed.  The food was just ok and the presentation was not impressive.  The soup was spilled all over the plate beneath it and they just threw a few tortillas on my friend's burro...seriously no attention to detail in this place.  I can't imagine a manager was on duty last night because I can't imagine they would let the restaurant run this way.

We were supposed to meet at 9:30 but it was around 10:30 when we actually got to the bar. We walked in and had our IDs checked and then stood around awkwardly...I'm not sure why this happened, but after a few minutes we were asked if we needed a table. Yup...that's why we're here. So we were seated near the bar. The place is large and the decor is fine, but the music they were playing was mainly from the 90's and made the place seem less 'hip' I guess, not that I know much about being hip. We waited for about 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. The waiter finally came by and took our drink order. I got the agave basil margarita ($8.50) which was soooo good! I was very happy with the drink. The Birthday Girl got a blueberry bliss... which wasn't what she was expecting. I tried it and thought it was good, but it was definitely more like wine than a mixed drink. The others got beers. 

So the real problem, for me at least, was my second drink. I got a tropical margarita ($7.00). It was one of the worst drinks I have ever had and was a challenge to drink. It was SO acidic and just nasty, I swear the two drinks could not have come from the same place...but they did. That's a huge red flag for me.

Side note: Why do restaurants think it's cool to not price their signature drinks....why should I have to ask how much it costs? I find this completely ridiculous and annoying. The drinks didn't end up being very expensive here, but I feel like I should have that information available to me on the menu just like any other item.... *ok steps off soapbox*

As far as food goes, one of my friends got a side of fries that were pretty good and came with bbq sauce, but other than that we did not eat. I have heard good things about their food from other people. 

After we were done with our second round of drinks (and the fries) we decided to move on to another bar.....but we couldn't because we had no check! Our waiter, who had been almost harassing us towards the beginning of our night, had completely disappeared. He finally came by like 10-15 minutes later and reeked of cigarettes....there is no way he only smoked one because I could almost taste it...pretty gross for a waiter. Anyway, our checks were brought fairly quickly after that and we were finally able to leave.

I went to Sam's Cafe last night with two of my girlfriends and based on my previous experience at the downtown location, I figured we'd get a pretty decent meal.  Not the case!

Carter, our server, was awful.  I hate to be so hard on him but as soon as he took our drink order and we didn't order any alcoholic beverages, he went downhill from there.  My friend Allyson ordered the rotisserie chicken special and I ordered the applewood smoked pecan salmon.  DeDe had a few question before she decided and Carter not only had no clear answers for her, he didn't bother to try to get the answers.  Unacceptable!  (Just to clarify, these were basic questions such as 'what kind of vegetables come on the fire grilled vegetable tacos?' and 'What is the marinade for the chicken fajitas?')  

The next thing we know, we are given their special chips and salsa... I love how they combine sweet and salty in a colorful arrangement!  Those were delicious.  However, it was a good ten minutes until we saw our water and when you are eating salty chips and salsa, it's nice to have something to wash it down with!  Minus star #2.

So, our food comes and DeDe's fajitas are totally different than what Carter explained.  She isn't bitchy about sending them back but kindly asks for just the chicken and vegetables on a plate since that is what she was expecting.  This is where the 3rd missing star comes in - I am not kidding when I tell you that DeDe did not get her food until after both Allyson and I were done eating ours (and we were eating really slow)!  It was not right... and Carter was not very apologetic.  He came over to offer us a free dessert but being that we are all in healthy eating mode, we declined.  They did take the fajitas off the bill in the end, but it was expected at this point.

So, I know it was just one bad experience, but if I feel like Sam's Cafe again, I will probably head to the downtown location or just have lower expectations in the future.

Bottom line:  decent meal + bad service = 2 stars!",review,Uov4o_7gRqQKQyjVhWOpVA

704,"{'funny': 1, 'useful': 3, 'cool': 5}",user_18,VBaU3qO1c8O2ESCZEbNriw,4,2010-09-05,"I love beer. No I'm not talking about the mass marketed, mass distributed stuff that supposedly tastes great and is less filling. I'm talking about the flavorful heady craft brews that are interesting and actually flavorful. I enjoy beer much like I do food; it's a celebration of diversity, history and sensual stimulation, simply put, it appeals to all of your senses. One of the many cool things about beer is that it's like a meal in itself. With so many varieties to chose from there's bound to be one for every individual appetite out there.  Now where to get a great pint for a reasonable price?

If you're not familiar, Four Peaks Brewery has been serving up tasty pints in the valley for years. Having 2 locations and a loyal following of people who appreciate beer, tasty pub grub at super low prices, both locations are pretty hopping on most nights. If you've ever heard of Kilt Lifter and 8th Street Ale which are served in most valley restaurants, those are Four Peaks creations.  The Tempe location actually has the whole brewery thing going on in a large warehouse type space, which was a creamery back in the day that now has the massive stainless steel vats for making some of their most beloved brews. The Scottsdale location has a similar warehouse feel including a more private mezzanine level. The bartenders and wait staff are very attractive and friendly, which you know gets kudos from me and if one of them is sporting a beard, even better! Though with the case of our server, it was definitely style over substance, maybe a bad hair day?

Besides being with friends there isn't anything that goes better with good beer than good food. The menu seems to have been written with the beer in mind as well as used as an ingredient. The menu isn't super large but is easy to navigate with many salads, sandwiches and pizza's to choose from. Aside from everything being well priced, the portions are quite hefty, you won't leave hungry.  If you visit their website, be sure to sign up for the daily menu specials email. You'll receive 2 emails a day that features lunch and dinner specials for that day or night. The specials menu really gives the Four Peaks chefs a chance to be even more fun and creative. They can also be followed on Twitter as well as Facebook, isn't social networking great?!

Great meals here begin with a great beer.  You'll notice a chalk board up on the wall displaying which beer is available including its alcohol content. You can use this as a point of reference as to how loaded you might end up. So be careful with the darker beers, not only will they fill you up like a meal in a glass but tend to get you snookered before the meal arrives. The Portero Chingon ($3) was an amazing Porter full of dark complexities with hints of chocolate and coffee. Those notes for me paired very well with the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($14.50/$17.50) which had a nice sweet and smoky sauce loaded with tender chicken breast. Pizzas come in 2 sizes, 12"" and 14"" but the 12"" is of good heft and made a great appetizer for the table. 

To stand up to some of the stronger flavors of beer, the Bleu Light Special Burger ($9) with its thick juicy patty, hickory smoked bacon and smothered with blue cheese crumbles, was well grounded and a solid choice. Just to let you in on something, Four Peaks makes amazing beer bread it's similar to a really soft pita and makes for a great substitute to an ordinary bun. All sandwiches are served with your choice of beer battered fries, pasta salad or a garden salad; I went for the fries and couldn't have been happier with my choice. The fries are so light and crunchy you might finish yours and eat off a friend's plate and no I didn't do that. Yes I did.

Now some sandwiches are served natively on beer bread like the Grilled Chicken Beer Bread ($9). They start with grilled chicken breast then add sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms, green peppers, red onion, mozzarella and then top with a creamy cucumber sauce for a Greek/Mediterranean flare. Try ordering a Hefeweizen ($4) to accompany since the bright lemon notes tasted so great with the chicken and vegetables on the sandwich. Or, have a beer sampler with your meal ($9) so you can taste several different beers and see which one works best for your tastes. The melted Swiss cheese and the tangy sauerkraut on the Reuben ($8.50) tasted good with the Kilt Lifter ($4) but I'm excited to try the Oatmeal Stout ($4) next time.

Beer bread, beer battered fries and drinking beer, sounds like a beer fest right? It get's even more interesting for desserts, you wont find a Tiramisu like this one. Called the Stoutamisu ($5) they take espresso soaked chocolate sponge cake, then layer it with Oatmeal Stout lady fingers and chocolate mascarpone cream. Its feather light and a mile high though not as sickening sweet as many I've tried. Goes down like many of the Four Peaks brews, nice and smooth.",review,LzNJLEIo4gh-X_rmDkNkNg

It's filled with so much charm and romance we both were simply glowing with post dinner elation. The place, Vincent's Market Bistro is the scaled down version of the fine dining classic Vincent's of Camelback. It's funny that a place like this is so well hidden without even a hint of signage beyond a sandwich board on the street. Just look for the main Vincent's sign and follow it around back to the Market Bistro entrance, they're housed in the same building. 

Chef and owner Vincent Guerithault keeps the menu decidedly French with hints of Southwestern flare that he's so famous for. You should look this guy up; he's got some accolades including a James Beard award under his belt. Does kudos translate to good cookery, you bet!
 
For one of my favorites, be sure to look for the Curly Endive Salad ($9) with mustard dressing, bacon, and a poached egg. I saw it, I ordered it, I swooned over it. A well balanced ratio of salty, sweet and sour then fresh cracked pepper completes the equation. 

Pizza offerings are done well with a tender pale crust that seemed more akin to pastry then to your typical chewy crispy offering. Tarte Flambée ($8) was topped with a light cream sauce, bacon, onion and thyme. Another pork laden pizza was the Caprese ($8) topped with pesto, arugula, mozzarella and prosciutto. I just wished that the greens were put on after cooking instead of before.

For dinner you'll find classics including the cooked in its own fat Crispy Duck Confit ($16) with lentils and bacon, sensing a porky theme here? The tender mallard leg was succulent and intense in flavor while the lentils performed well by countering the richness of the meat. For something a little bit lighter, I use that word loosely, order up the Coq au Vin ($10). Red wine braised chicken served atop gratin potatoes were hearty and comforting. 

Vincent's Market Bistro also offers a $20, 3 course Prix Fixe menu. On my last visit delights were abound with the likes of creamy Butternut Squash Ravioli, Rainbow Trout and a scrumptiously sour Lemon Tart. This has to be one of the best deals in town that I know of. I mean really, food from a James Beard award winning chef at these prices is unheard of. 

Great food, good prices and excellent service all set in a romantic atmosphere, well; there is one caveat, the hours. Vincent's Market Bistro closes at 8pm, so plan on eating early.

Only a few have the power to lure me out of bed and one of those is the promise of a big satisfying breakfast. Of course not by my own hand but by someone elses because lets face it, I'm that lazy on the weekends.

So when I decided to cover the much buzzed about Joe's Diner it was sheer excitement that got me out of bed. You know a plate full of perfectly cooked eggs and bacon paired lovingly with cups of hot coffee and glasses of fresh squeezed orange juice are true motivators.

As we saunter in we're welcomed by an upbeat good morning and sat pretty much immediately. Located in what used to be a classic car shop, husband and wife team Joan and Joe Seriale transport you back in time with 1950's nostalgia complete with glitter flecked seating and old tin billboards and neon signs. There's a flurry of waitresses and I kept waiting for Flo to appear with her huge red nest of hair but she never showed up.

Concerning breakfast there's always that one nagging question, should I go savory or sweet? I say do both starting out with one of Joe's homemade Cinnamon Rolls ($2.59). The large yeasty bun arrived laying in its own caramelized brown sugar and cinnamon pool, complete with an oozing topping of cream cheese frosting. I nearly stabbed my partner with my fork after he took the best part, the tender loved filled center. When I eat a cinnamon roll I like take my sweet time, licking and nibbling on the outside, making sure I don't miss an inch of that roll. Then once I get to the center I'm gratefully rewarded with a mouthful of gooey pleasure.

The Number Two ($6.49) is the more versatile choice when it comes to the sweet and savory dilemma. You get two eggs, your way, two sausage patties, two bacon strips and a short stack of fluffy pancakes. This plate has your bases covered with the addition of thick ropes of maple syrup which the pancakes gladly guzzle down. For an alternative try the strawberry jam in lieu of the syrup, some rules were meant to be broken.

Joe's Homemade Biscuits & Gravy ($2.99) gets you a plate full of light-as-air biscuits grounded by a layer of sausage gravy. The gravy had a faint sweetness that was a surprise hit at our table.

If you're having a rough morning from one-to-many last night, try this remedy, Joe's Breakfast Burrito ($6.59). Stuffed tight into a soft flour tortilla are three scrambled eggs, chorizo, potatoes, and cheddar cheese served with a sides of sour cream and salsa. Or try the Breakfast Bowl ($7.59) which gets you scrambled eggs with ham, bacon and cheddar cheese served over home style potatoes. Both were filling and satisfying, the only thing was a couch afterwards to nap on.

I foresee Joe's Diner getting me out of bed many more times in the near future, especially after dreaming about cinnamon rolls.",review,D1T1jtCfTfXD-cQE3QViow

I'll admit it had been many years since I came here, so I don't have a 'relationship' with this place. I went today though and was reminded how great it is. The same owners have had custody of it for well over 20 years and they took fantastic care of it. I asked one of the staffers about the owners and they pointed to the bar and sure enough, there they were... looking just like I remembered them from over a decade ago.

When I first was introduced to this bar, I'm not even sure if I was old enough to drink there - if so, barely... There was this awesome lady playing jazz on a piano and singing. I can't even describe how great it was or be sure how accurately my memory serves me. Even though it has been four years since they have had regular jazz music performed live, the legend of it lives on in spirit. All of the 'hip' and 'cool' pumped into this joint over the years still seeps out of the walls. 

I had heard whispers and stories here and there that she died or committed suicide, but couldn't get a confirmation or denial from staff - just that they don't do jazz anymore. Bummer... I'm told they do have bands play sometimes though. Something I may have to investigate further, but I have my doubts about it being quite as cool.

Still, the place has a fantastic sprawling patio that spills out and blends with the surroundings... you can also wander up a staircase to chill out with a date near a fireplace in a small cozy spot with a view of rooftops and Camelback mountain. Inside isn't much bigger than a repurposed train car, but with all the windows and doors opened, the place is indoor/outdoor. 

There were only a handful of people there when we went - they all seemed to be regulars and were pretty friendly. Having not been there in forever, I asked - apparently, they get a decent crowd on the weekends and it's mostly regulars - ""industry"" folk (meaning people who work in local restaurants and bars). 

It's not some type of downtown douchebox that most bars try to be... there's an obvious lack of pretension and a cool breezy attitude. Perhaps part of it was how beautiful the day was this Sunday afternoon in March and that this watering hole is the perfect spot to chill out with a cold drink on some rocks. 

A girl I was dating had introduced this place to me when I was about 20 - her little secret that she felt she could trust me enough to share. She loved the jazz lady and I remember going there with her to listen to music and we would chat with her between sets. Go check it out... you'll know within a few minutes if you love it or not.

It's brightly lit and brightly colored, with a corner shelving unit stocked with kids books and games (they have Cooties!). I could see this being an easy favorite for neighborhood kids. 

Free WiFi is a bonus for folks who want to hang with some ice cream, coffee, and a laptop. It's open until 9 pm. 

That said, how's the ice cream? A few of their flavors are off - like birthday cake. I felt my teeth falling out after one bite. But usually every ice cream joint has a flavor that doesn't agree with you. I'm a big fan of mint chip and I'd say theirs was decent. Average, I guess would be more accurate. Kona coffee is pretty tasty, though. They have about 16 flavors on display daily which isn't the greatest selection but you should be able to find something you'd like (probably not the blue bubblegum). Friendly ice cream servers are more than happy to answer any questions you may have.

Now, word to the wise. Their portions are HUGE. Seriously. Massive. A single scoop is more than enough, and I'm a guy who can woof down ice cream like no one's business. Because it's really four scoops disguised as one. Maybe five. So if you're feeling like ice cream after your Z Pizza next door, maybe a kids scoop is more your speed.

All in all, Pink Spot doesn't give you the greatest ice cream in the world (be it produced in Hawaii or California or wherever), which is too bad. But it's still ice cream in central Phoenix, which will always be more than welcome. An open place to work with your laptop if every table at Lux is full.

My favorite fried rolls are the Las Vegas which has a ton of flavor and comes with a yummy sweet sauce drizzled on top and the calamari roll which actually is not fried but the squid inside is. This one tastes really great if you add a little dollop of sirracha hot sauce to it. I usually try to limit us to either one or the other so that we don't get too much fried in one meal so last night we went with the calamari and also our other usual maki. The one with the three different kinds of fish (Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail) is delicious. You get so much fish and it is always such good quality and so fresh tasting! I also love the Tucson roll and last night we added cream cheese to it just to make things a little more interesting. It was perfect! I am a huge shrimp fanatic so this one is just really tasty. I also like to order the cucumber roll. My husband does not eat cucumber so I have to consume the entire roll myself but it is just so fresh and light that this is not a problem. I love the crunch of the cucumber... and it goes so well with wasabi and ginger flavors! Just delicious. 

To top it all off, they still include salad, miso soup and edamame with every meal.

Only three 5-star restaurant reviews, and two are hole-in-the wall Mexican joints.  Self, why is that?  Well, I love Mexican food, but don't get culinary on me with it.  And my only expectations for 5-stars are great but cheap food, adequate service (if applicable) and not seeing a roach flit by.  Yet, in a nicer place, I expect the whole package.

My husband and I had dinner for the second time at FEZ last night.  Upon walking in, we notice our less than spectacular server from the last visit was working.  I remarked that I supposed we would be unfortunate enough to have him as our server again, and he was.  But wait!  Is this the same guy?  Maybe he had a bad night before, maybe management flogged him after my first review.  Anywhoo, he was attentive, efficient, and friendly from the start of the meal through picking up our check.  

Our food was fantastic, and hot this time!  We had to have the hummus and those sweet potato fries again, diet be damned!  We shared the ribeye, and it is definitely enough for two. The ribeye was a wonderful cut and cooked to perfection.  The accompanying summer vegetable succotash was light and crisp, and perfectly complemented the steak.  We also shared the chocolate mousse, though by now I was wishing I had worn elastic.  Mmmmm.

My group has done an event here where we asked the awesome folks at Ruby Room to throw down some old time vintage cocktails.  Not only did they do it big time (even using raw egg whites!), but they even did a special vintage drinks menu for every day use!   You have to try a Pink Lady.  Heaven, I'm telling you.  (They hold the raw egg for ya, but still mmm mmm good.)  Even the vintage menu is printed on a naked lady picture.  Maybe this should be called The Naked Lady?  

Well, they can't do that because in this neighborhood folks would think it was a strip club.  And with no windows and a super dark interior that rivals only the original Chez Nous I can see how someone might think that.  

Speaking of the neighborhood - this place can be tough to find.  I have a friend who circled the place 2x before I had to go outside to flag them down.  I got cat calls while I was out there.  Speaks much more for the neighborhood guys hanging outside the convenience store than it does for me. But if you're ever looking for a little confidence boost - walking out here in a short skirt and flagging down a car is always an option. Though other cars may stop too... 

Anyhow, the DJ's seem cool but I've never been there later than 10:30 so I've never seen a band or gotten too deep into a DJ's set.  I'm lame, I know.  But the music played when there aren't DJ's and bands is pretty dang cool.  WIDE variety.  Count Bassie, Blondie, Nouvelle Vague, Paul Simon, Stray Cats, Some funky band I never heard of but plays cool stuff.  Actually, there was a lot of that.

I will say that our waitress, Anna, was really sweet and knowledgeable.  You could tell she's been working there for years.  We started with the red lentil soup which was delicious and Anna brought us a taste of the spinach curry soup as well - it was spicy but tasty and had me excited for what was to come.

We went with the Sleepy Gyro Salad and the 'Vegetarian Plate II"" which was more than enough food for us to share.  Too bad none of it was that great.  The vegetarian plate came with hummus, baba, falafel, dolmas, tabbouleh, spanikopita and yogurt sauce for $12.45.  Not such a deal.

2.5 stars.

I suppose I had higher expectations after hearing about how beautiful the DBG gets during Las Noches de las Luminarias.  Bedazzled homes, malls, and restaurants have impressed me more in recent years that these plastic versions of brown paper bags with spent votives and ropes of lights wrapped around trees just seem amateurish now.  Don't get me wrong, there were moments where I did succumb to the beauty of it all, especially in front of the lighted and decorated giant Christmas tree and around a couple of bends when I spotted pillars of lights wrapped around the tops of a couple of buildings, beckoning me to come in for a closer look, while snippets of smooth jazz music would land on my ears like tantalizing silk ribbons...  Perhaps it was just too crowded tonight-- I didn't know it, but there was a buy one, get one special for the Luminarias exhibit ($12.50 per person, instead of $25).  There were so many people in attendance, that at one music stop, my cousin and I had to retrace our steps, as there wasn't at outlet around the mass of onlookers.  We felt bad for those families who had relatives in wheelchairs, for it was very cold, very dark, and very crowded to walk around safely.

I know that with the right company (someone to walk hand-in-hand and snuggle with) and fewer people there, I'd have enjoyed myself better.  However, I don't think it's worth $25 admission per person on any day!  (I'll just hike around the block at my place a few times for cardio and spend $50 to decorate my home with mood-lighting...

1. Location
2. Atmosphere 
3. How clean it's kept 
4. Events they host 
5. Giants Games 

Whether it's summer, winter, spring or fall, every time I drive by Scottsdale Stadium, spring training excitement hits and I begin the countdown before the best time of year in AZ. Scottsdale Stadium is the lucky home to the Giant's Spring training and so when February/March hits, the venue will be hustling and bustling with locals and visitors all sharing the common love for the All-American sport. A top favorite of mine within the stadium is Charro Lodge which is a fabulous area in center field that serves all inclusive food and drinks during the game. It's one of the best deals in town and if I ever have a couple of extra bucks to spend in the spring, it goes towards a ticket here. But, on most weekend game days, you'll find me pitched on the famous grassy noll in center field, enjoying the game with friends and maybe a couple cold beers. 

The stadium is always clean. Always. I don't think I've ever witnessed a dirty stadium, regardless of the attendance. It's easy access to any of the best Old Town restaurants and bars to visit after a game and the environment is one of excitement and loyalty for both Arizona and the love of the game. 

But, I've learned over the years that Scottsdale Stadium doesn't close up shop on April 1. In the fall, they host fall ball which is where top baseball players come to practice and allow scouts to check them out. It's open to the public and the games are at night. I just recently experienced the Old Town Farmers Market in the Scottsdale Stadium and I must say that I was really impressed!! It's a great way to stay cool in the summer heat and still enjoy the local flavors available at the Farmers Market. The City of Scottsdale will also host other various events throughout the year at Scottsdale Stadium, so I've learned that I need to keep an eye on this gem of a venue in the heart of Old Town!

Our Salad and bread came. and just a note to the veggies out there, remember to ask for your salad salami free, as it usually includes salami. The Salad was decent bit heavy with the creamy Italian dressing and cheese but good.

For my main dish I went with the salmon pene. The salmon it self seemed to be of a lower quality, it was pre cut to little chunks and a bit over cooked,  the sauce was under the pasta making it messy to toss on the elliptical plate.

The person I was with got the stuffed shells, the ricotta was a bit too creamy for our tastes. 

It was a decent filling meal, at a decent price but the quality is not the highest.",review,RQWliUrWic_b5FZEj3JThQ

First off, I should confess, my band had played earlier that night and for that reason I had consumed a few cocktails, but I was by no means out of control. 

It was late when we wheeled into Jackrabbit and coughed up our requisite $10 entrance fee. Drinks were expensive, not outrageous, but not cheap by any means either, especially considering you're paying just to put a foot in the door. 

I didn't catch any of the entertainment since it was very crowded but I was pleasantly surprised by the flow of traffic. There is a nice little outdoors area and the separation between rooms facilitates walking and mingling. 

Contingent upon the crowd on any given night, this place could be packed with thirty thousand dollar millionaires or the more modest variety of Scottsdalers, just out to have a good time and be entertained.",review,KwGQqUCpHHhOhVqyOL2QTA

I went here once out of curiosity, and then the other 4 or 5 (yes really, that many) times I have been because that's where everyone else already was and we got invited.  Let me remind you, I hate Jimmy Buffett music.  It's so annoying!

Aside from the fact that I am inundated with music that I can't stand, and usually it's the same three songs over and over, the food here is not bad.  I usually get the coconut shrimp because they are always crispy and they actually taste like there is some coconut on them, unlike most places that like to overcharge you for ""coconut"" shrimp.  It also comes with a really yummy marmalade dipping sauce.  I actually love their peel and eat shrimp though.  I think they are boiled in beer or something, and they come in a big giant clam dish filled with ice.  Kind of weird, but it makes me laugh.  The shrimp themselves are really yummy, tasting exactly like peel and eat shrimp should.  The cocktail sauce they serve with it is a really nice pairing to the shrimp.  It's moderately spicy so it doesn't kill my tastebuds before I am finished eating.

The service here is usually lacking.  Well, I take that back, it's always lacking.  You have to track someone down to get refills.  Aside from that, I have never found any of my servers to be particularly personable there.  Maybe it's because they hate Jimmy Buffett music too and they are miserable because they work there.  Or maybe they are just sick of dodging that stupid person on stilts who makes balloon thingies.  I hate that person.

Considering there isn't a whole lot to do in Westgate, Margaritaville isn't a bad option.  It gets crowded really easily though, so put your name in early or come on a non weekend night.  This place is just okay, but the tourist factor appeals to a lot of people.",review,YeDYa6tYL16CyqYvUVOtLw

On my first visit to this place, I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised at how new it was. And that the bar was the size of an entire restaurant. And that the restrooms had doors to the alley and to the bar. 

I was here on a Saturday night with friends to celebrate a birthday and we got this amazing deal for two hours of bowling and shoes for $10. The place was nearly empty (I think because it was probably between leagues and disco/glow/whatever you wanna call it bowling) and completely pristine. The staff was courteous and we had a blast. 

I still wish that bowling system interfaces weren't so damn unfriendly, but that is hardly a situation unique to this alley.

One thing that was sad was that we really wanted the glow bowling to start early because no one was there but us and we were excited. In fact, 40 minutes before it was slated to start, they put down the projectors in front of the lanes and started some of the spot lights but didn't start the music videos or dim the lights. When I approached them to ask if we could possibly start it early, they said no. I then inquired as to why everything was 3/4 set up then, and they said, they do it slowly at set times. BORING. I understand if you're busy. But no one was there but our two lanes and one lane that just joined beside us. Out of like 30 something lanes (I'm guessing). For that I will knock you down a star.

Buster's offers traditional bar food along with some seafood, steak, and specialty items.  We chose to sit in the bar although none of us partook in their happy hour (which goes until 7).  Aside from the waitstaff, we were the youngest people in the place (by a decade or two).

I checked on Yelp and Gabi came to my rescue!  Based on Gabi's and Karri's reviews, I did not need another referral to fall back on- if Duane was good enough for Gabi, then he was good enough for me!

I called Duane on Monday hoping I could have him visit the house that afternoon, but I'd have been happy if he could see me as early as Thursday.  Duane informed me that while he was fully booked that day, he could see me the following day, which meant I'd have to call out of work.  As much as I hate calling out of work unless I'm really sick, I knew that 1.) a leaking tank needed attention or else my house may necessitate lengthier, and costlier, amendments later on should the leakage cause other problems, and 2.) one should never waste water, especially living out here in the desert!  

Not only did Duane attend to all the repairs in 90 minutes the next afternoon, but included in that time, he also assisted in choosing a garbage disposal at a nearby Home Depot to replace the one that wouldn't work anymore, despite his assumption that it was nothing more than a stuck penny or broken glass- this has happened once before.  I should add that I had him look into a second toilet tank that a housemate had complained about.  Where a disreputable repairman could have taken this opportunity to charge me for unneeded repairs, Duane revealed to me his honest and trustworthy nature in telling me that the tank didn't need any repairs done!  He was also more than happy to show me how to do future repairs myself and also offered to walk me through them via phone in the future, should I elect to go that route!  I agree with Gabi and Karri in that his fees are more than fair, and that he is a very amiable and approachable individual.

The tortillas along with their cilantro butter are nothing short of amazing. And they should be.  I mean, it IS called the Old Town Tortilla Factory, so they had better be delicious.  

Other than that and the expansive twinkle-lit patio, there's nothing to really write home about here.  I found myself here twice in the past week so I was able to enjoy some great patio dining.

It seems like every Mexican/ Southwestern restaurant says they have the best margarita in Arizona.  OTTF makes that claim on the back side of their menu, along with a litany of other awards mostly from Citysearch.  City what?  City who?  The award-winning Treasure margarita looked impressive and robust presented with the shaker - providing an extra drink or so.  The taste was not anything out of this world like I expected.

The patio is really huge and makes up probably 70 percent of all the seating in the establishment abutting the quaint historic adobe home - meaning fall and spring are definitely the times to go here.  But the green plastic chairs - gahh!  A charming and impressive patio is diminished by the cheap picnic ambiance the chairs emit.

The food is ok.  The first time I had the Poblano de Mariscos -- stuffed poblano peppers filled with crab, cream cheese, herbed butter, roasted corn, diced red bell peppers with a shrimp cream sauce. The reality?  Stuffed peppers with mostly cream cheese and a smattering of crab flakes.  I couldn't even taste the crab.  The second time I ordered the tortilla soup and it wasn't all that great either.  It was more red than orange and had more chicken and not enough tortilla than I have had elsewhere.  It's ok if that the way you like it, but I will pass.  

The salsa was the worst though.  Mostly a red tomato sauce with bit of chile included.  It was the most mild and un-spicy salsa I have EVER had in my life.  I think Pace mild sauce is hotter than this stuff. Since I was with my friend Maya and a friend visiting from Queens, I was shouting ""New York City?!"" - mocking the old Pace commercials.  Maybe they accidentally served us Ragu.  Who knows? All was fine once we asked for habanero sauce to spice it up.

They have a far better than average draft beer list, including 2 offerings from Four Peaks, a few imports, and the obligatory macro-swill that so many Americans prefer.  Great that they had HopKnot.

Prices were reasonable and service was average.  The female server ""uniform"" of a skin tight white shirt should not be worn by everyone.  It looked great on the thin girls, but for the others it just highlighted the spare tire that shouldn't be there when you're that young.

Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)

I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)

p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!

I could tell he knew a lot about the products and it made me feel even better about what I was about to purchase.

Back up to the register we walked... this time with my hands full of all kinds of goodies for Minnie.  Steve rang us up and when he learned that Minnie and I were both Wag N' Wash virgins, he set us up with a VIP (Very Important Pet) Card... which gives us 10% off of every visit and $10 back when we reach $300.  That may take awhile, but we're on our way having spent almost $50 today... and that's before we've even attempted part 2 - the Wash!

Part 2 coming soon... stay tuned for when Minnie needs a bath!",review,lBRCMN7wNn-BKUsaOXJRow

2.5 stars.

Took my young cousin w/ me for happy hour and sat at the bar; This was her first time at O&I.  While I really like the look and the feel of the island layout of O&I's bar, I always feel like a fish out of water when I sit there.  (I've actually tried sitting there a few times when I've walked in solo, but always ended up moving to a table.  If it weren't for my cousin at my side, I probably would've moved to a table again, or, worse yet, walked out of the resto, which I've done before, too.)  Despite a few attempts at getting her to try a cocktail, she declined, and thus I proceeded to just order a glass of wine.  Why it's so hard to get a sampling of a couple of wines before settling on one to order here, I'll never know.  (Just a few nights ago, while at Beckett's Table, my server offered to have me try sips of the two wines I was having trouble choosing!)  Tsk, tsk, tsk!

We decided to try the Italian Sausage flatbread and the hummus app.  The flatbread, w/ its tasty and spicy Italian sausage chunks, consisted of a crispy crust w/ vibrant red piquillo peppers and creamy goat cheese-- I'd order this again, even though peppers and I don't exactly get along.  The hummus was equally delightful, w/ house-made pita bread and a ""petite Greek salad,"" which actually consisted of only sliced red grape tomatoes and chopped cucumbers (a no-no for me!) and a ton of feta on top.  Why the salad was piled ON TOP of the hummus, and not on the side, I don't know.  I suppose for the price of the app, I shouldn't expect more veggies used (a bit of lettuce, perhaps?), but it would've been nice to be able to pick the cukes out.  Served as it was, on top of the hummus, which looked like it was baked for a few minutes before getting the salad treatment, spooning the cukes off would've entailed major loss of delicious baked hummus goodness.  And we wouldn't have any of that!

I really wished we could've stayed past 6p to check out the celebrity guest bartender, but we had other appointments to keep.  My cousin really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here, and I'd have given this review another 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that our bartender gave us such an attitude when I asked to sample the two wines first before ordering.  

FYI, the happy hour menu changed, drastically reduced to only maybe 8 items or less, down from practically all of the apps and half of the flatbreads and a couple of salads that the old HH menu contained.  Recalling this, plus the wine and salad/hummus incidents, I may just have to say goodbye to O&I for a long, long time...",review,53YGfwmbW73JhFiemNeyzQ

As a teen, it was a place to pick up something small here and there (cards, lamp, frames), and dream about what ""my house"" would look like.  In the early 20's, I was still just getting little things (posters, candles, linens) because I had no money, but I would have fantastic dreams about what I would do - one day.  Moving into the later 20's, this became my go-to place for creating upscale Christmas baskets. (My favorite was an Italian night basket with the pasta, pasta sauce, bread sticks, Italian cake, chocolates, a few bottles of wine and wine glasses - and something special like a CD or special espresso beans.  A classic given and appreciated SEVERAL times.) Now in my (sigh) 30's I've completely resigned myself to the idea that I will NEVER get anything but little things here.  And I'm totally ok with that.  Cost plus is my favorite place for Christmas.  I do stockings for my whole family and I can find things that work for everyone(Ornaments, Chocolate coins) and things that show I was really thinking of them (This year's had a theme - everyone got drinks but that ranged from Thai Chai to Japanese Saki).

My new favorite thing about Cost Plus is their jewelry section.  It's made huge leaps forward in the last 5-6 years.  Almost all of it is very ""today"" with prices that look very yesteryear.  I found beautiful handmade beaded dangling earrings for $5.  An amazing matching necklace was $15.  These both could have gone for 2-3 times this amount and been absolutely worth the price.  Let's home they don't realize that any time soon....

While agreeing with a previous post about the cost of the furniture, I'd say it's most likely worth the cost as those expensive pieces have always seemed quite solid.  But then again - I don't go for the furniture. The things I love, which is a good chunk of the store, can each fit in a hand basket.

If you haven't been to Cost Plus before, give yourself some time and walk down each aisle.  It can be amazing the things you find hidden in the shelves that you might have missed if you just scanned down from the end.  And wear comfortable shoes - you might be there awhile.",review,u8bQvtkVa5lW-SNwRLH6Vg

I mean, how many times have you driven by HB Hanratty's and have never gone in? For me, countless times over 3 years. The saloon-fonted sign for HB Hanratty's was simply just a geographic marker whenever I headed east or westward on Camelback and nothing more. But last night was the night that changed things. 

As I said, danky carpet smell which took 5 minutes for me to get used to.

A place that has three pool tables, a Wheel of Fortune pinball machine, 3 dartboards (one with electronic scoring), plenty of wooden booths, an electronic globe randomly flashing the logos of any and every NFL sports team, and an internet jukebox with countless selections but still mostly blaring out the sounds of Led Zeppelin (and 10cc's ""I'm Not In Love"" - which played TWICE). 

A friendly bartender encouraged us to shoot some pool, to which we gladly obliged. First game, on the house. What bar does that, dive or otherwise? Nice. And with follow up games only 50 cents a pop, it seems like inflation hasn't hit this place as bad as everywhere else. Drinks also pretty cheap. Not much choices on draft, but Bass in a bottle did just fine. 

So, again, 4 stars for being a solid dive and a convenient place in central Phoenix to just have a beer and shoot some pool. Sure, Rosie's is up the street and has its own charm, but a neighborhood dive and an Irish pub aren't the same thing and I don't see them directly competing with each other.

Yesterday (10/21), I prepared my own honey-buttermilk pancakes w/ Ghirardelli choccy chips, sliced bananas, and a handful of those cinnamon-roasted almonds I found at Costco.  While those hotcakes made for an excellent meal, they weren't the protein pancakes from US Egg nor the custom-made ones from Good Egg I've been craving for the past two weeks.  So, after visiting my internist in Chandler to hear some great news (excellent triglyceride levels- HDL is a roaring 89!), my yearly physical, and to give more blood for yet more tests, I decided I'd stop at Good Egg and claim my free entree w/ the customer appreciation card I've been holding onto for more than a year now.

My server Bailey was amiable and attentive.  She suggested I try adding dollar pancakes to my entree since I couldn't decide whether to go w/ some pancakes or something off of the lunch menu.  Thanks to the two Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives' episodes on breakfasts I'd seen during Monday's treadmill routine, I also had a craving for some corned beef hash (or those wonderful hash browns from Matt's in downtown Phx).  I decided to go w/ a full stack of pancakes ($7.50) and a side of corned beef hash ($3.95).  While having breakfast, I looked over the dollar menu wedged conveniently between the condiments and saw that for a $1 more, I could have ""today's sweet deal.""  Well, Bailey, what is today's deal?  A choice between an apple streusel bread pudding w/ caramel sauce or a strawberry shortcake w/ house-made strawberry fruit topping, you say?  Decisions, decisions!  Thankfully, the caramel contained corn syrup, so that made it easier for me to choose... 

So there I was, for weeks craving for some of those blueberry-almond-wheat germ whole wheat pancakes and what did you think I ordered?  A stack made w/ sliced bananas, candied slivered almonds, and Ghirardelli chips!  Silly me.  But they were very, very good!  The toasted slivered almonds added a different texture from those whole candied almonds I have at home, and the chips at GE didn't burn on the griddle like those I'd made myself.  (I'd skipped the secret step to making great choccy chip pancakes... you have to coat them w/ flour first to keep them from sinking to the bottom when you add them to the batter!  Yesterday, however, I just topped my cakes w/ some chips, so no wonder they charred when I flipped them over.)  Um, but I digress...  The corned beef hash, ordered on the crispy side, was crisped nice and salty.  It could've been a little crispier, but these were good enough.  Loved the salt-sweet contrast- what a great meal!  The coffee was freshly-brewed and strong, and I liked having a thermos on the table for me to pour myself another cuppa.  Last, but not least, the strawberry shortcake was just the perfect way to cap a terrific experience at GE.  Well, that and the large cup of coffee everyone gets to take on the way out.  Now that's a nice touch!

I'd never been in the old Marvin's Garden diner, but it didnt seem like much could have changed. Hell, the booths even have signs saying you can't sit there as a single between 11-2, lol.

When I walked in the side door, a woman looked at me and held up one finger, so I nodded yes I'm alone. She put a menu down at the counter and had a bowl of celery soup and an egg roll before I got there. Pretty good start. I took a glance at the menu and ordered the cashew nut chicken and it came within 5 minutes. The place definitely seemed to have perfected the ""quick lunch"" concept. The service was flawless from start to finish, as well. Everything I had, including the usually bland celery soup was delicious. The cashew nut chicken being probably my favorite asian dish I've had in quite some time. It all seemed very light and on the healthy side as well.

I ended up with a bill of $7.33 which for the amount of food, and the quality of food, and the quality of service, I was very pleased with. They are doing a lot of things right here, and I think this will be a very successful restaurant in the Midtown dining scene.

Here it costs $5 to get in and with that $5 admission fee, you will enter a secret garden that is easily passed by thousands of times a day without anyone realizing it's there. Now for those of you who have been to Japanese Gardens in let's say, San Francisco or Portland, this doesn't even come close in comparison. However, the fact that we have one at all deserves a round of applause. 

This garden is small. You can easily walk through it in 10 minutes. It's filled with ponds, water falls, koi fish, trees and greenery. If you come here and want to take time to enjoy the setting, I encourage you to bring a picnic and set up shop on one of the many benches situated throughout the park. During your picnic you will enjoy a tranquil beauty and escape the hustle and bustle of Phoenix life. I encourage you to come here if you are ever in the area. It might be small and you might be in and out in 10-15 minutes, but I think anyone who lives in Phoenix should go at least once. Plus, there's a great coffee shop down the street (Fair Trade) and several other museums and attractions near by (Arizona Puppet Theater is across the street and the Phoenix Art Museum and Herd Museum are a few blocks north). 

During my visit, I witnessed a wedding taking place; an intimate wedding set against the backdrop of the trees and koi pond. It was a perfect location for pictures and a very calm and romantic setting. Based on the size of this garden, I assume you could have a large or small wedding quite easily.

Friend and I had a fantastic dinner here- my first time back since attending a Yelp event held at Firesky Resort months ago.  We chose to dine outside as it was a nice afternoon.  (Also, the restaurant just opened for dinner, so no one was dining indoors, yet.)  We were hungry, so by the time our server arrived for our drink orders (just water, since we had some wine at the bar and reception areas) we also placed our entree requests- the wild salmon sounded divine, so we both wanted it (she w/ fingerling potatoes and I subbing asparagus).  When it became apparent that we weren't going to get bread unless we asked for it (we waited at least ten minutes-- we were there early... we were hungry!), we asked if complimentary bread was available.  (It was, and with delicious marinated olives, too!)

Words cannot do these beautiful entrees justice!  As you can see from the photos, the salmon I had was so juicy.  The textures were exquisite-- starting at the perfectly-crisped skin, nicely seasoned; then immediately underneath it, the seared, buttered flesh; through the flaky layers, until you reach the tender medium-rare center...  There, there- I'm getting waves of goosebumps up and down my arms and neck just recalling those moments!  And the accompanying vegetables were equally splendid!  Crunchy, yet dainty asparagus spears flanked by olives, grape tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and fennel!  Mmm... I think it's time to check out restaurant.com for a gift certificate for another meal here soon :)  

Didn't know acquaintance James Siao is Taggia's ""chef de cuisine""- what a nice surprise!  He was so sweet to offer my friend and me a complimentary dessert to share.  All the desserts on the menu that night sounded great, but it was no contest-- we had to check out the tiramisu!  Taggia serves up a terrific version-- a marvel to look at, and so many layers to tantalize the tastebuds... So cool and creamy, and the cocoa used was of very high quality.  This dessert was packed w/ so much flavor, yet it was very light-tasting (and very light in the tummy, too!).  This tiramisu lived up to its name- a perfect pick-me-up!

I get that it is British food, and not fine dining, but that doesn't excuse mediocre quality food.  The husband and I were out and about in the Chandler area and were determined to try somewhere new and not a chain.  We searched and found this place and based on a pretty solid group of reviews, we decided here would be good for dinner.

As far as service goes, I really have no complaints.  We were seated promptly, our drink orders taken and we were left for about a minute or two to peruse the menu.  Our drinks came quickly and the server answered a few of our questions in regards to some of the crazy British names for food and we ordered.  I got the Beef and British Ale Pie and the husband got the Fish and Chips, because supposedly they are great here.

The Beef and British Ale Pie was pretty decent flavor-wise.  The beer flavor was quite prevalent.  The beef was okay but kind of dry and not as tender as it should have been.  There were mushrooms in it, which I thought was really nice, but there weren't enough for me.  The gravy on the mashed potatoes was quite good.  Their coleslaw seems homemade, but lacks seasoning.  The fish and chips did not look appetizing and the husband did not enjoy it.  The batter was painfully thick and overdone on the outside and underdone on the inside.  It was not a good fish and chips experience for him.

Nothing here was really terrible, at least not for me.  It's nothing to get me to come back either.  Oh well, at least that leaves more room for the people that seem to love this place.",review,FaiULYK26388GWz7v6tKpA

I typically order chopped salads at lunch.  The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.  

My husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal...

This brand new spot on 7th St just North of McDowell on Oak is fit into a Tudor-style home. Immediately I appreciate the historical preservation that is going on here. The front patio is filled with cafe tables with red umbrellas, inviting on a summer evening or during the Spring but not at 5:00.

We were greeted inside by co-owner Debbie who brought us around to the dinner case. La Piccola Cucina is very different than most restaurants you will come across. Part old-world Deli, part Luby's Cafe, diners can chose their meal a-la carte or can, for $9.99, pick up one ""protein"" and two vegetables. Strange as that sounds, it actually works very well.

Their ""protein"" selection is made up of veal, pork, and asparagus stuffed meatloaf, turkey, a couple different chicken selections, stuffed pork, and a few other meat dished. Their vegetable sides ranged from ratatouille, orzo, zucchini, asparagus, potatoes, beets, and a few different salads. This wide selection allows you to cater to your taste buds for the evening. The woman in line behind me was a vegetarian and she was able to order a nice selection including a salad.

My wife ordered the meatloaf with orzo and potatoes while I had the pork with ratatouille and zucchini. My pork was excellent, covered in a fig reduction glaze that really brought life to the pork. The ratatouille was one of the best dishes I had ever had combining sweet and fresh tastes perfectly. The zucchini was good but could have used some garlic and salt. My wife raved about the potatoes and thought the orzo was quite good as well. Then we got to the meatloaf.

I am not a meatloaf person but my wife loves it. I was intrigued by the sound of it but I am a pork person and will almost always order it. This meatloaf was more along the lines of a toasted meatball than an American meatloaf. Filled with veal and pork (two essentials in making a good meatball) it was perfectly crisp on the outside and had a small scoop of tomato sauce on top. The flavors were a perfect mix while each was distinctly unique and separate. Definitely a meal I would recommends to any and everyone.

The drink fridge was filled with an interesting mix of beverages you would find at Cost Plus or AJs. No beer but a nice fruit-soda and mineral water selection. Of course, they also had a fully functional cafe with coffee and espresso drink selections. If they could get a BYOB permit, they might really take off.

As we finished our dinner, the dessert counter that had been calling my wife was explored. Mini cheesecakes of assorted flavors, personal (slightly bigger) caramel cheese cakes, chocolate mousse, cream puffs, cannoli, tiramisu, and some traditional Italian cookies. Everything looked exquisite but my wife, predictably, went for the caramel cheesecake.

I, however, directed my attention at the gelato bin that contained about 10 different flavors. I went directly for the mint chocolate (my weakness) but there was chocolate, limoncello, blood orange, some coffee flavor, and some others. All were beautiful rich colors but the mint was all mine.

Both desserts were fabulous. There is a need for a traditional Italian pastry deli in downtown and there is definitely a need for a gelateria. This fills both needs and is a short stroll through the Coronado neighborhood from the light rail. La Piccola Cucina also serves sandwiches for the lunch crowd at around $7 or $8 a piece and they sound wonderful. This place is highly recommended and will positively see our business again.",review,NNGJQF3WeIHzGzweCpZ-VA

Everything building up to the food here is superb: the atmosphere and decor, the vibe, the service, and the menu items. Everything on the menu is a unique creation of the restaurant, and the group I was with really enjoyed mixing up our selections so we could try a little bit of everything. We loved everything on the menu down to our designated driver's soda choice: Spicy Ginger Ale from South Carolina, the original Dr Pepper straight from Dublin, Texas, that sort of thing.

Then came the actual food. I wouldn't say it was terrible. It was just... not spectacular. And sure as hell not worth $22 or more per entree. For starters, every plate we got was lukewarm. But I can quickly get over such foolishness by the waiter to judge the cook's creation before it was allowed to sit on a counter for too long. And the cook's creation was not that great. I sampled their signature dish, the mushroom pan fry ($24), and it was probably the tastiest I had. The Louisiane Gratin ($12 for an appetizer portion) and Mediterranean Eggplant ($22) were ordinary. The pork-belly sliders were satisfactory. Everything here is basically satisfactory. My taste buds want way more than that for this price level, that's all. I have a feeling Cowboy Ciao gets away with this only because it's in the heart of downtown Scottsdale.

The first night was post Downtown Tempe Light Parade (which was quite chintzy, I don't recommend it). We were walking to Casey's from Mill and 3rd and decided to pop in for a drink to check it out. I liked the dim lights and warm atmosphere. The long and narrowness of it reminded me of a Portland or SF bar. It was busy, but not crowded and still had open tables on a Friday night.

The beers on tap were posted in good view on the chalkboard (most hover around $6 and go up from there to $10 for a pint - pricey, but this is the good stuff: Lagunitas, Chimay, etc.). They also have a cooler with a larger selection of local/micro brews from all over the country (Ska Brewing, New Belgium, etc). Those were as cheap as $3 per bottle, and up to $8 for the rarer or larger bottles. They have wine as well, but I didn't check out the menu.

Speaking of menus...they should keep these (if they even have them? I never saw one) at every table. It's a little disconcerting when you walk in because there are couches, tables and a bar. It's small enough to wonder i f you're just supposed to order at the bar.  While you wait to figure that out, you realize only the chalkboard of taps reveals what they carry. So on my first night I just ordered off the chalkboard. But once the server came out to take our order, she was very cool and knowledgeable about the beers, and helped me pick one based on what I normally drink. She offered tastes as well.

The second time I came in, my group wasn't in a six-bucks-per-beer mood, so we headed to the cooler. I assumed it was like Papago, where you make your own selection and bring it back to the table or up to the bar to add to your tab (again with that uncomfortable ""i'm in a new place and not sure what is protocol""). But eventually a bartender came over and popped and poured our drinks into glasses. 

As I looked around a little more on the second trip, I realized this place looks just like Starbucks - complete with the same exact light fixtures along the bar. Literally, you could replace the bottles behind the counter with syrups and this would be a Starbucks. All of the sudden this place went from ""warm and homey"" to ""generic suburban cool"" and  felt uninspired. Compounding that, you can bring in take out from Tessio's and Thai Basil next door, and plenty of people were eating pizza out of the box as they drank their expensive beers. I admit, bringing in takeout is pretty cool, but it doesn't really jibe with the atmosphere and décor they're going for - is this place a stylish new pub or a pizza parlor with beer?
 
But I have such fond memories of Tops the liquor store that of course I'll return to support their latest endeavor. Also, it's yet another step in the chic-ing up of Tempe. I'll certainly drink a six dollar beer to that.",review,H-pXhtIE-rRfHiusL685ng

Up at the counter you can grab a special vegan or gluten free menu to carry around with you as you build your salad or pour your soup. It seems pretty obvious with salad, but sometimes you don't know... especially when it comes to salad dressing or toppings.

I have eaten here a ton of times, but the new office trend is getting the salad to go. A HUGE container for just salad comes with two small containers for dressing and a bag for bread. $3.99. You WILL be full. If you want the whole chabang (salad, soup, and potatoes) it's $5.99.

Yep, it's true. So imagine my sheer delight when my creative work cohorts and myself planned an outing to the newly opened D&B's in Tempe Marketplace. I was so excited, I arrived like 10 minutes early to scope out the place. 

Sure, I had been to Jillian's at Desert Ridge. I had fun, but wasn't impressed with their games. That's why I thought D&B's would be, like, so much better. (cue the rolling of the eyes...now!) 

Why can't I have my adult playland? Why do I have to be surrounded by crappy arcade games and whirling, twirling stupid sound machines? No, I don't want to actually be 10 again and be amazed by cheap arcade games. I want to be amazed I can go someplace and pretend I'm 10 again. Make sense?

So, my friend and I started at the air hockey table. Uhm, since when did the air hockey puck not float and get stuck in the sides of the board? Talk about a killjoy. After that, we headed over to the fenced in basketball goals. You know, those crazy ones that moves back and forth and shout obnoxious things at you? Yeah, those. Eh, after a couple games, I'm bored. I don't want a moving target. I want a real shoot out competition. That's why I was glad to see real basketball goals, two of 'em, so I could have the shoot out I wanted to badly. That's where you'd find me, if I were to ever go back to D&B's. Forget the air hockey and motorcycle video games. Nevermind the boxing game that's surely rigged (I was totally ducking, a$$hole!). I'm camping out at the basketball game. To me, it's the only one that feels like a grown-up game. 

Yeah, the trivia game is fun, but one round is, like, 5 questions. It takes me longer to tie my shoes. Sheesh. Rip off. Let down. Talk about a premature... Ok, so maybe I'm going overboard. 

Back to the games. With air hockey, trivia, boxing and both b-ball games played, what was left? I went on a hunt to find the martial arts game, cuz, let's face it, I love that game. I love pretending to kick the livin' $hit out of somebody. Well, I couldn't find it. Talk about the rest of the air deflating from my wanna-be balloon. 

So, the real question is this: Did I have fun? Yes, I did. I admit it, but I spent a great portion of my time wandering around, hoping and wishing for more adult games, like virtual reality and the kind you'd find in a ""Must Be This Cool to Play"" arcade. I wanted to throw real punches and kicks.

I am a sucker for strolling mariachis, mamacita servers in red frilly dresses, festive digs and authentic and delicious Mexican food.  Usually one or some of those elements are missing from your typical Mexican restaurant. It seems like not much to ask for, but I can't seem to get it all at once in Phoenix.  They even somehow manage to pull it off without seeming cheezy or contrived.

I'm not that surprised though. Tradiciones IS right next door to Phoenix Ranch Market, which was accurately described by Mr. K as Mexican Disneyland and is what Food City wishes it was.  Since the entire strip is a renovated K-Mart from back in the day, Tradiciones has taken over the old Garden Center space, which you'll notice is now a cool plaza-style patio with space for a band. It's hard to choose between their inside or outside, but indoors is where you'll find the lunchtime buffet if you're in a hurry, and a high ceilinged dining room and more Mexican murals and colorful decoration you can imagine.

I was here most recently for a business lunch with suits and formality and all that mess. 

Food highlights include the Bistec ala Mexicana simmering in a red caldo of veggies and sauteed beef strips (reminiscent of my mom's btw), the pollo margarita simmered in margarita mix with chipotle ranch and queso fresco was ok, but the clear winner was the seafood enchiladas (shrimp and veggies in a lobster cream sauce) - simpler than how they do at Barrio, but every bit as good.  I really enjoyed the fresh lemonade.  This place also passed my Mexican litmus test of beans, rice and tortillas (they have to taste at least as good as my grandma's).  If a restaurant can't master those staples, then it's a hopeless effort.  

The servers here are quick and courteous, but speak Spanish for the most part. The food was about a solid 4 stars, but the service, decor, atmosphere and just plain real-ness elevate it further to 4.5 stars.",review,vA8T8QXh78iSXhxShLNgQA

So many reviews and so little time I guess.  Anyway, I can't understand why this particular location has more than a few crappy reviews.  Ra as a chain provides some of the better sushi around and this location is no different.  At some other sushi places you never really know what you are going to get.  This sometimes can be a good thing, but if you want consistently good/fresh tasting sushi at a reasonable price, then Ra is your place.

I honestly have no complaints about Ra's Mill location.  I always get great service and great sushi.  I do agree with a lot of the reviews on here that the music is too loud though.  I really hate having to yell to my table-mates and struggle to hear what they are saying.  I dunno...maybe I'm just getting old.  The decor/bathrooms have pretty much remained unchanged for years and years and could use an update as well.  That's pretty much it for my complaints.

I went here last night at about 8:30ish with a party of 6.  It took a while to get seated but it wasn't too bad.  The place does tend to get crowded so be prepared.  Our waitress was excellent and was quick to refill my diet coke.  We ordered several rolls and some other stuff that I can't remember but it was all fresh and excellent as always.

We spoke to the new general manager (Blake) and he is awesome.  It was nice that he came to our table to make sure everything was ok and offered some excellent recommendations.  He also talked about how he is trying to turn the place around and has replaced some staff and is expecting a total remodel this summer which should be interesting.

However, they now have a different chef and I decided to give them a second chance for restaurant week. I went with a friend earlier this week. So for my three courses I got the bacon and eggs app, the short rib pappardelle, and the taste of sacher dessert and she got the salad, the braised pork, and the fritter dessert. They started by bringing madeleines, which tasted a bit like cornbread and were very tasty and an amuse bouche of spiced egg salad, which was bland at first taste, but had a really flavorful and spicy after taste. My app was very good, the egg was poached perfectly, the red pepper sauce was flavorful, and the bacon was tasty (I don't even generally like bacon...so that's a compliment). My friend said she liked her salad, but it seemed like a pretty simple salad. The short rib and pasta was very good. It had a creamy sauce and little croutons that added a nice crunch to the dish. The short rib was good, but could have been braised a bit longer (still had a little more solid fat than I like), but it was flavorful. The dish looked small, but it was very filling. The pork was just alright, it was braised but somehow it was a bit dry. The flavor was a little barbeque-like, it wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad. I would definitely go with the short rib over the pork. My dessert was good, it was like a dessert playground! It had little chunks of chocolate cake, which was a bit dry, but it was easily remedied by the delicious, rich, creamy chocolate mousse (or something...thought she said it was gelato, but if it was, it was the most creamy gelato I have ever had) and the raspberry frozen bits, the fresh raspberry, and the apricot sauce....on top of that, there were these little crispy chocolatey things on top of the cakes....so good! The fritters were just ok (in my opinion), go with the chocolate for sure. I think the cotton candy was alright, but kind of gimmicky, but I really like that they give you a little dessert to take home. Ok, so I was teetering between a 3 star and a 4 star review, but I decided for the restaurant week price (or the sunday supper price) this place is great!

4 stars!

Took Mom here for dinner.  It was her first visit, and since I've never tried the calamari app here, we had to order it.  (Have I mentioned that she loves calamari?)  I also ordered the Day scallops and Forbidden rice.  The calamari, which was served on a heaping pile of mizuna, a delightful coating of yuzu dressing, and then topped w/ a toasted mix of black AND white sesame seeds, was heavenly!!  Had we not ordered the scallops, we would've been happy w/ the calamari app and another round (or two!) of the cracked honey-wheat bread and herbed butter!  However, the day scallops DID NOT disappoint!  Mom wasn't too happy that I ordered this, due to the fact that she thought the cost was price-y.  But one look at our dishes, which our server took the liberty of splitting for us (no split plate charge, yay!), had her amazed... She's never seen scallops this HUGE before!  (The biggest she's ever seen were an inch in diameter.)  A plate of these come w/ only three pieces, but each piece is about three inches in diameter!  The cross-sections may have looked a bit raw, but these were perfectly seared, trust me!  And, while I won't ever try it again (very bad allergy reaction), the forbidden rice, which sat in such delightfully-fragrant cream sauce, was divine!  If you aren't allergic, you must try it as a side, perhaps w/ the scallops.  (I don't see the entree listed online, so it might have found its way to the menu graveyard- a pity, that.)

2 stars!

I've always wanted to take Mom to Bloom for happy hour, and after having the calamari app four nights ago, it didn't take much prodding for her to accompany me here today :)

I like dining at Bloom during happy hour bec. more often than not, it isn't very busy.  But that just means (one hopes, anyway) that you'll get quicker attention.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case today- it wasn't busy at all (almost empty venue), but our server took at least ten minutes from the moment he greeted us to finally getting our orders for glasses of water.  It was another 10 minutes before we were able to have a look at the drink menu!  [Fortunate for Bloom, the happy hour food menu is worth coming back for- we'll just know better to park ourselves at the bar, like I usually do when I dine solo.]

For beverages, Mom ordered the Blood orange margarita, while I had the Black and blue mojito.  Mmm... the margarita was very good!  [If only I wasn't allergic to oranges.  :( ]  My mojito was still delightful- Mom sampled and liked it, but she enjoyed her margarita better.  Her drink definitely was a looker, and made my mojito looked a bit worse-for-wear :(  I'll have to try another drink next time...
 
Onto the food!  Mom had to have another plate of calamari, while I had only eyes (or should I say stomach?) for dessert.  Since I raved about the banana dessert plate I had months ago, I had to have it again, especially when the manager mentioned that it was going to be replaced by another in a couple of months.  Sadly, my second taste of this sweet concoction couldn't hold a candle to the first.  (Like most experiences in life, eh?)  The chocolate-dipped frozen banana slices now only numbered four (first plate had five), and these tasted old and bland; the toppings weren't even crispy!  The texture of the banana muffin cupcake was crumbly, and tasted stale, almost frost-bitten; the milkshake uninteresting, almost like the third-of-a-glass that's sometimes forgotten and then returned to, but now too far-gone and not worth having anymore.  I felt like I was handed the short-end of the stick, which was then taken back from me and then stuck, repeatedly, into my eye.  :(  I should've taken the hint to order something else.

The food was as excellent as all of the other reviewers stated. We sampled several rolls, veggies, soup, sashimi, tempura ect.   The place itself big, with modern tasteful décor, and the tables were nicely spread out. They have a huge sushi and robata bar and a lounge to the side with all different seating arrangements. The back room we were placed in was big but intimate enough for our group. Our server was exceptional (his name was Casey) he was quick to offer suggestions and really knew the history of the drinks. If I had a restaurant I would steal him away and put him as head waiter!

So why the 3 stars? Timing, or in this case lack of timing. 

We were seated and brought the first round of rolls before our drink orders had been placed.
We actually received 4 orders of rolls before we received our drinks. 
We were served drinks without sake cups, soups without spoons, rolls without soy or wasabi... 
It was a complete mess. I am sad to say the lack of timing really disappointed us, I would return because the food and service were excellent, but I would not recommend it for big groups.

Homemade sweet potato chips were tasty but not too heavy, and we both loved my butternut squash corn enchiladas - the tomatillo verde sauce really made it stand out, and I love how the tortillas were baked until the ends were slightly crispy.  Side salad was a perfect complement with those cute little crispy tortilla strips that I can't find in grocery stores.  

The falafel with pita was fairly good but was almost too small for anyone with a normal appetite (only 3 small falafel croquettes).  Although we did not have beer/wine there were a handful of choices, and I was pleased to see Hoegaarden, Anchor Steam, and a few other craft beer choices.  

Restaurant is divided into two areas, one with small seating & kitchen/bar that leads to a covered hallway with outdoor seating, followed by the main dining area with numerous tables.  Decor somewhat suggested a homestyle European feel but I could be off on that.  Location is actually a good couple of tenths of a mile west of Shea inside a small shopping area just off Shea, and it's on the eastern side of this shopping area.  Parking is excellent, and this is an underappreciated feature of restaurants today.

I was hoping for breakfast like the other location, and it was disappointing to note that they're only open for lunch as well.  Portion sizes could have been larger, especially for the entree prices, or conversely the prices could have been more modest given the size of the orders.  I'm not sure what the norm is way up north of the 101 on Pima, but around Shea/Scottsdale there are a lot of delicious choices for less.

I left a message and then anxiously called back a few hours later after not getting a response. The second call was quickly returned and I was informed that while they do not typically send out rescue volunteers for smaller birds (only the big guys like owls, etc.), if I could capture and transport the bird to their sanctuary, someone would be there until 7 p.m. to accept him and begin to nurse him back to health -- even on Easter Sunday.

The little guy was speedy! Together, a few of my Easter guests and I were able to corner him and get him in a box for transport to Liberty Wildlife Rehabilitation Foundation.

I have been wanting to try this place for awhile as it gets favorable yelp reviews, and after my Dad and I went through every type of food out there (want sandwiches? no. Thai? no. Chinese? no. and on and on) I suggested this place. I'm glad I did. So we got there around 1 pm and we had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table. Once we were seated, it took quite awhile for anyone to come help us. So that's kind of where the points were taken off. That and there were no chips to go with their fabulous salsa unless you get guac (which we ended up getting). So initially we ordered the elote (corn on the cob covered in cheese and paprika.....much better than I though it would be.... although I have no reason to think it wouldn't be good.... hmmm), two pork tacos, and a carne asada torta. The tacos were good, but I hate to say, if I wanted to get a taco just like that I may go to America's Tacos, just for convenience because they are priced similarly and sized similarly. The torta, however, was very delicious. The meat was tasty, the roasted tomato tasted very nice, and if you put the tomatillo salsa on it.... wow it's delicious. Plus the bread was nice and soft, but not soggy. So we also ended up getting guac (just a side dish of it, so 3$ instead of 7$) at the extreme recommendation of our server, and it was good, but not the best guac I've ever had.

I waited years for the excuse to shop at Mexican Import. I would pass by on the way to spring training games, the farmers market or Sunday brunch and I always wondered, ""will I ever have a need for any of the items in that store?"" It's full of authentic and fun from the land of tequila and sun but the items are not necessarily ones you ""need."" That is, until I saw a fiesta on the horizon and when I did...I realized that my time had finally come. 

Mexican Import has pretty much any knick knack you can imagine for a reasonable price. Sombreros (both authentic and costume), fiesta attire, pinatas, shot glasses, ceramics galore, puppets, blankets, maracas (large and small), rattlesnake gum (not as scary as it sounds), cowboy hats, desert post cards and anything else you need with southwestern flare. It's a store that you wish existed for that one off chance you need a sombrero hat on the fly. Even if you aren't in the market for something they carry, this is still a pretty classic store to browse on a weekend afternoon.

You'll find Homme Lounge on the North side of the street (just east of 7th Ave)- well advertised with its bright, large sign. Parking, on any normal night, is not a problem. I can't speak to their French Kiss Fridays, for I found myself there on the Saturday before Halloween. 

Cover is $5 and the dress code is relaxed, thankfully! The doorman was your ""standard"" friendly - polite, nice, welcoming. So was the bartender. I think he called me ""sweetie."" Ordering my beer was a cinch, for I was one of few patrons there before 11 p.m. Prices for a bottled import are reasonable. 

Right when you walk in, you take in the entire ""lounge"" in a single blink. There's not much to this place, although it is inviting. It reminded me of past favorite hangouts in other cities. I liked how it was pretty dark - the closer you got to the dance area, the darker the room. Perfect for me. I claimed a table in the corner and grooved to the ambient house/breaks music. Soon, after one beer down, I stood up to dance. Nobody was really dancing that night, but that didn't stop me. I figured they just wanted to ""lounge."" True to form, there are mirrors on the wall. Personally, I don't like to watch myself dance - it kind of creeps me out. I prefer to just see my shadow cast against the wall.

Like I said, it was the Saturday before Halloween. Centaurs, Croc hunters, Satan and Supermarket Sweep contestants could be found here. It was quite the mix of people. Shortly after 11 p.m., the front part of the ""lounge"" filled up... just enough for patrons began to trickle closer to me. (I shared dance space with a Centaur. How many people can say that?!)

In conclusion, I understand the draw of this place, especially during an event or regular special night. It's the kind of place you go with friends. I don't mind going out solo - especially if there's a spot for me to dance - but I found myself bored after about an hour there. I can't really blame the establishment for this, yet I do minus a star (and end up with a 3-star rating) because there weren't more people here that night. (It's not like it was a Wednesday, after all.)

As for the area, I felt completely comfortable going solo and had no problem walking to my car around 1 a.m. Knowing that, I will be back to Homme, probably some Friday night so I can see if the hype of French Kiss really is more than just hype.",review,yPpPJyAF8pciHnhTF-C38w

It had nothing to do with the Tempe 12 calendar babe celebration going on - which, with the titillating (no pun intended) video in the background, was pretty to look at, the pervy sausage fest who were early, or the textbook Old Town Scottsdale drones afraid to take group party photos for Stephy S..

I love slick ultra-lounge spaces like this complete with my favorite Barcelona chairs and a fancy encased aquarium, but it didn't quite deliver for me.  We somehow lucked out with a VIP table because we were super early, I'm sure.

WEAK:  
* I had a few of the French/sweet potato fries the group ordered, and perhaps because I'm used to the fries at Delux, I thought they completely sucked donkey balls. 
* The restrooms are kind of rad.  There are a half dozen private loos with clear glass doors that become opaque when you lock the door.  Apparently those are all unisex until a certain time when they're reserved for women, even when there aren't any around.  At that point all the guys in the joint have to squeeze into one bathroom.  I was chased from going in to one of the bathroom (with no women around) by a bathroom attendant and schooled on the system.  Not cool. 
* Service was great until the billing situation was bungled and left people in our party confused on who was paying what, who was overcharged, etc.

Even though it's not exactly my scene, I would come back on a weeknight (never a weekend).  It's not my cup of tea, but I can appreciate an upscale Scottsdale lounge when I see one....go with the right people and I'm sure you can have a good time, here or anywhere for that matter.

We also shared some appetizers for the table including Crispy Calamari, Parmesan Risotto, and Warm Beets.

I went with the Crab Cake for my entree... much better than the sea bass I had previously during my first visit.  Served with avocado, cucumber, and a sweet sauce, the serving size was plenty, and it was delicious!  The texture was crispy on the outside, and warm and creamy on the inside.  I also dug into the sides that we shared at the table including asparagus, creamed spinach, roasted mushrooms, and french fries that came with the burgers... (my mom, J, and Z had burgers).  My dad really enjoyed his Veal Porterhouse.  And as if we weren't full enough, we shared a few desserts.  My favorite was still the Carrot Cake and everyone else loved the Apple Tart.

Well, this is no Kentucky Derby, but the spot is still pretty cool for Phoenix! It's legit horse racing and has everything from a winners circle and grand seating to betting and plenty of regulars. The crowd was classic. Imagine rowdy college'esque meets dive bar regulars. The drinks flow here and they have plenty of options for gambling. You can gamble with $2 or $10 bets, or $100+ bets. They have plenty of concession stands with typical sporting event food and they also had a BBQ section that had decent burgers etc. 

Here's a fair warning. This place lacks a solid flow of AC unless you're in the clubhouse section. So this means, summer heat and indoors at Turf Paradise don't bode too well, so come prepared with a fan and plenty of water. This was a fun spot to watch live horse racing, but it wasn't the best to watch the Derby since the tvs are small. The live horse races happened about every thirty minutes and were fun to watch!

I am not sure if I ever got the format right, I always order at the counter, but it would seem some people placed their order with a waiter.  either way the meal is quick and a fair price.

With veteran deli owners Nicole Dorio and Jay Friedman, quality and freshness are high while the prices are low. Hero only uses Boar's Head meats and cheeses, which you've probably seen before in the expensive side of the grocery store meat counters. This makes all of the difference in quality comparison to the places, left unnamed, who sell $5 subs. You'll notice the difference! Then there is the bread! Covered with toasted sesame seeds, the toothsome bread has a light bagel texture, slightly chewy while remaining tender. No wonder since the bread is sourced from our own local Chompies bakery.

When you set foot inside the first thing you're going to notice is the smell. A mixture of onions, meat and tomato sauce fragrances permeate the air inside causing an instant and raging hunger. The deli counter is broken up into 3 different areas, each more moth watering then the next. The first case is filled with all sorts of delectable salads and desserts. Then there is the meat and cheese case, where the owners slice the meat to order whether for a sandwich or by the pound. Then there is the hot section which has steaming hot dishes of deli classics like sausage and peppers and meatballs, the fantastically overwhelming smell was quickly fingered. 

Ordering can be a bit tough due to the fact that everything sounds so wonderful. Signature Heroes both cold and hot, wraps, salads and sides make up the large and straight forward menu. Place your order at the counter, pay, then grab a seat and you'll be called when its ready. Once this process is started you can watch as your meat is sliced and your sandwich assembled. Ive always enjoyed watching my food prepared, you can learn so much for your own kitchen. Yes, Ive already ordered my very own meat slicer so I can do this at home on the weekends when Hero is closed.

The heroes at Hero are big, thick and piled heavy with meat, cheese and toppings. 2 big eaters can easily share 1 hero sandwich and a side no problem. Being the big bear that I am I did barely manage to finish one by myself and was quite miserable for sometime after that. Fortunately parking in downtown Phoenix is kind of spread out so a nice walk afterwards will really help out. The easiest method would be to park in mid town then take the light rail to the Hero Factory, it runs right by.

With so many heroes to chose from I went ahead and put my trust in the owner Jay. He immediately tells me that his favorite hero is the Manhattan ($7.95). Anything with ""man"" in it has to be good, right? A thick stack of roast beef piled high on toasted garlic bread all covered with melted mozzarella cheese. This sandwich was in its most pure form, no veggies and sauces to get in the way, just the simple flavor of good meat, cheese and bread. When he came to check on his sandwich I asked for some Russian dressing for a bit of a variation, this single element added that extra dimension that turned the Manhattan from good to great! Their Russian dressing is some of the best I've had. They really should bottle and sell this dressing, can't wait to try it on a salad! Of course the owner is going to know what's best to eat off of his menu. It was great that he didn't say the generic phrase, ""everything is good on the menu"".

Taking matters in my own hands, next up was the Crackerjack ($7.95). While not as anti-holiday as I was looking for this one was simply fantastic! Thin sliced cracked pepper turkey, oozy melted pepper jack cheese then dressed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and their amazing Russian dressing. Each bite of the spicy turkey and cheese was a hard contrast to the sweet flavors of the holiday; this one definitely has some heat to it. If something all American is more your liking, then the Patriot ($7.95) will be a home run! Roast Beef, turkey, ham and American cheese topped with lettuce, tomato and onion. You can never go wrong with the basics at Hero.

What's a deli without trying some of the home made salads? The cheese and bacon tortellini salad ($1.75 1/2lb) was so creamy, smoky and tender, one taste was not enough. In fact this one was so good I didn't want to share with my table mates. The deli case also had a tomato and mozzarella salad ($1.75 1/2lb) that was perfectly dressed with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Each cherry tomato exploded with sweet tangy flavor contrasted by the balsamic coated mozzarella, delightful.

The hours at Hero are limited to weekday mornings and afternoons which may be the only drawback to his location. Since the light rail is moving finally and more businesses are opening downtown, perhaps the hours will include a Saturday? I sure hope so, I really love this place!",review,LRuIY8JFqadCSYLo242MGg

Things are turning around though, and I'm D'lighted to get my review'n skills back in shape. 

I'm surprised I hadn't eaten here before. I guess I didn't even really know it existed to be honest. I live within a few blocks of here and I love breakfast and I drive by here frequently. Perhaps it is because I'm not a member of the vegetarian/vegan community... though I've dated several vegetarians and vegans so I'm pretty up to date on the places to go for that. 

I haven't had my food at this place yet - I've only eaten from the drive through. It seems like a cute little place though. One of these days. 

The food is tasty. It's about as tasty as it can be for something that can be considered a healthy breakfast. I tend to prefer a good thick greasy unhealthy artery clogging pile of bacon and some sort of fruit covered waffle or french toast drowned in maple syrup - that doesn't seem to be what this place is about. Still... it's true to its name. It is definitely delicious. 

Their prices aren't too bad for what you are getting. It's quality food. I mean, I was getting burned out on shitty fast food breakfast places. I can't stomach the Breakfast Club douchetastic crowd most of the time, and I haven't been really up for eating around any sort of crowd on my weekend mornings. I'd rather eat in the comfort of my own home these days. 

I'll have to update this when I have more to say about it - so far, I've only really sampled the food. I have yet to really experience the atmosphere and the service. Sooner or later though...

I'd say this is yet another reason why I still stand behind my belief that Scottsdale is an awesome place to live.",review,-4A5xmN21zi_TXnUESauUQ

I strayed from Short Leash inorder to spread the wealthand try something new.  Their menu featured a spicy sausage sandwich,  a Caribbean pork sandwich, a pulled pork sandwich and probably another sandwich or 3 I failed to mention.  
The wonderful aroma of smokey goodness filled the air while I waited my turn to order.  Deciding on the pulled pork sandwich, to go, it only took a few minutes to prepare the order.  

The sandwich was served on a very sturdy roll that stood up to the sauce on the generous portion of pork.  On top of the pork just enough coleslaw and the top bun of course.  The price of the sandwich includes a bag of chips, a wet nap and a peppermint patty for dessert.  

The pork was nicely smoked and not overly sauced, the slaw did not overwhelm. The bread...couldn't tell if it was purposely toasted to the point of slighty dry in order to accommodate the sauce or if it was just dry. I'll. consider it the former.

If you've never been here, prepared to be overwhelmed. Seriously. The menu is so big, you don't know where to start. Go with a friend who's been and can give you pointers. My lunch friend made a couple recommendations. I ended up ordering the Mona Lisa. I was gonna nix the lemon capper mayo, but I figured a little wouldn't hurt. Whoa. Both slices of bread were slathered with this white stuff. Not bad taste. Just bad on the waist. 

The sandwich was very, very good. Smoked salmon with sprouts on pumpernickel bread. It was very good, and I was very hungry. 

But I just ordered one sandwich and it came to $7.57. That doesn't include anything else. No drink, except water (which was tap). I'm told they charge for everything here - every little extra you ask for. So, my cup of water my have cost me. Who knows. 

My sandwich came with a ""free"" cookie, too. Come to think of it; maybe they charged me for that too!

Would I be back? Well, yes. You buying? I mean, I love a good sandwich. I also love getting my money's worth. For $7.57, I would have hoped for a sandwich large enough for me to divide between lunch and din-din. No avail. I wolfed the entire thing down happily. Even better, it didn't make me bloated later, which I feared, since most foods tend to be heavy on the salt.

The interior is a bit messy in the sense that it's chaotic. This is more of your lunch rush place. Order. Grab. Eat. Run. 

When you place your order, they ask your name. Then they call your name when it's ready. I told the cashier how to spell my name, so when the order-yeller looked peeved that nobody was picking up the sack, I felt no remorse. ""Alisia"" is not how you spell my name.

Is the new Vig as fabulous as the original Vig with their boche ball clad outdoor patio, live music Sundays and a great hang-out any day of the week? Me thinks my answer is...yes! 

And here are 10 reasons why:

1. The indoor patio is brightly lit, but saves 'zonians from melting in the heat. It's genius when you think about it. Now you can choose which Vig to visit based on your temperature desires. So, if you want an outdoor patio, go to the other Vig, but when it's 115 outside, I'll see you at the Uptown spot. 

2. They serve greyhounds with freshly squeezed grapefruit. You can't find a freshly squeezed cocktail very many places in the land of the desert. 

3. Boche Ball. See it exists, even at the new location! And it's large and in charge and big enough for a group to play. 

4. Friendly staff. They're attentive, friendly and aim to please. 

5. Spacious and perfect for a big group. Check out the area by the fire place. It's perfect for mingling. 

6. Awesome spinach dip with these tasty (sweet potato?) bread sticks for dipping. 

7. Tastilicious flat bread pizza with Tandoori Chicken - it literally melted in my mouth. 

8. Lovin' the Central Phoenix vibe and location. It's close enough to the Camelback corridor and within driving distance for most of the Phoenix/Scottsdale neighborhoods. 

9. Great HH specials depending on the day. Check out their $5 Vignature cocktails. 

10. And let's not forget about the entertainment. The DJs with accompanying instruments make the Vig rock and I heard a rumor live music is coming soon.

It was on a Tuesday, and I was fortunate enough to stumble onto the online menu beforehand and find that Postino offers $20 bottle of wine AND bruschetta on Tuesdays after 8pm.  I was a little wary that it seemed very noisy inside, but there was no way I'd have my cousin steam outside in the patio after she had just recounted how perfect the weather was in San Francisco, a stop she'd made before arriving in PHX.  

We had a blast!  For $20, the two of us enjoyed a nice bottle of Heron chardonnay and a platter of six HUGE bruschetta halves (ricotta with dates and pistachios; smoked salmon with capers and herbs; roasted red peppers and goat cheese; and prosciutto with figs and mascarpone). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#oGjoq-y0BpTf_Ug6K6vmgQ  My non-sweet-toothed cousin's fave was the peppers and goat cheese.  It was good, but I always have red peppers and goat cheese, and since I have a ROARING sweet-tooth, my #1 fave was the ricotta, dates, and pistachios.

For the rest of us, it is a bit of a nightmare.  While the stadium is great, its location hurts it the most.  It is a must-see during a Cactus League trip but for locals, it is probably not worth the drive unless you're a fan of the teams that play there.

Situated just south of Bell Road and just past one of the worst intersections in the Valley, Suprise Stadium stands out.  It sits in the middle of a relatively empty complex which is part of the problem.  There isn't anything to do around the stadium before or after the game making it hard to make this stadium a destination.  It is best to take Grand Ave to Thunderbird and then go north on Bullard.  

Once you reach the stadium, parking is free, which is nice, but is sometimes confined to dirt lots.  The stadium is beautiful and reminiscent of the Rangers' big league in Arlington.  There are nice grass seats and newer wide seats behind home plate.  The seats down both lines are drenched in sun, however.  Shade can be found on the concourse under the press box but it is a narrow passage that gets crowded on hot days.  The upper level seats are quite nice and, like Peoria, offer shade and a wait staff.

The food options at Surprise are somewhat limited.  There isn't much in the way of independent vendors which leaves you to the standard ballpark fare.

Surprise is a beautiful park.  It stands out in architecture from every other park in the league.  It is like a Major League park that has been shrunken down.

Thankfully, we were off this past week and were able to finally go on a Friday evening.  We showed up at 5 and we were pretty much the only ones there for a while.

Big positives for having the baseball game on in the bar & for our waiter being pretty awesome.  I had seen in a tweet that they had a BBQ pork sandwich that I just had to try and it was really the only thing on my mind.  All of the nonsense about sharing and tapas was completely lost on me.

We did order what amounted to fried cheese sticks.  They were okay.  They were made with fontina cheese and the sticks were pretty good but the sauces just didn't do it for me.  One of them was even pear-flavored.  Ugh.

The wife also wanted to try the mac & cheese with ""lobstah"" so we got an order of that.  It was pretty good but was served too hot.  I know that sounds weird, but the cheese was all runny when we got it.  It wasn't until we were about finished that it turned into a creamy mac & cheese.  Too bad.

All of those complaints aside, I really didn't go for that stuff.  I went for the bbq.  Considering I had tried about 3 different bbq porks over the previous three days, I was beginning to consider myself an expert on the stuff.  The Tuck Shop bbq was wicked good.  It came with sweet potato fries that rivaled Fez (they were even cinnamon-sugary too).  The sauce was a bit spicy and really wasn't needed considering how juicy the pork was.  Really, it was great.  It was a special though, so don't show up looking for it on the menu.

Finally, we finished out our meal with a German chocolate cheesecake.  I'm not sure why I ordered this; I hate German chocolate and I can't eat cheesecake...but I ate some of it anyways.  It was so good.  Really one of the better desserts I've had.  

To top this all off, I had ordered some lemonade which was actually really good.  I guess they make the syrups there in-house and, while not a traditional lemonade, it was pretty damn good and had free refills.  No complaints there.  Next time, I'm getting the ginger ale.",review,rQ4z0EStSZE4acgkne6Hmg

To some, DJ's is like Cheers...everyone knows your name. At least it was for me when I first moved to Scottsdale. For some reason the Wildcats deemed this one of their bars away from college so I gladly accepted it and ran with it. Years later, the Wildcats frequent DJ's less, but I still think it's pretty darn fun for an occasional night of a dive, cheap drinks and Big Buck Hunter. 

DJ's is just a typical dive bar. It's not fancy and it doesn't look like Mr. Clean, but they do what they promise; they offer cheap drinks in a decent setting for local bar goers. For a dive, can you ask for more? Oh you want games you say? They have those too. They have Big Buck Hunter and another one -- maybe Golden T? Did I also mention the drinks are cheap and stiff?

That's not their fault in any way - I was just too young.  My mom was a peaceful hippie going to ASU the year they opened.  The next year - presto - me.  I hear we went there now and then.  All I remember was lots of patchouli and eating banana chips.  I still love banana chips but I digress...   In the mid 80's my brother was put on a ""special"" diet to help curb hyperactivity (Good-bye chocolate, Hello carob) and back we went to Gentle Strength.  It had been several years since we'd gone and I remember my mom saying how much it had changed.  She would hardly recognize the place now.

Gentle Strength moved to a new location recently and this has given them lots of room to stretch their wings.  I hadn't been there in years, but I went for the first time (as an adult - no banana chips needed to keep me happy) a few weeks ago.  I have decided that I will be a regular.  It was one of the best shopping experiences I've had in a LONG time.  Yes, shopping experience.  No free samples, dance music or water slides - but the people were just amazing. And not just the folks who worked there. People shopping said ""Hi"" to each other - and to me.  I had a 10 minute conversation with a guy who'd been a member for more than 20 years.  By the end of my 30 minutes there I'd joined in the spirit and when someone asked me if I knew where something was I walked her on over, helped her read some smaller labels - sharing opinions and a laugh.  

You don't have to be a member to shop there, but it does have it's privileges. (See web site for details) 

Their products are awesome.  I saw some basics that I've seen other places, but I saw tons of stuff that I just don't see at other stores.  From their awesome selection of easy to make Asian food, amazing looking produce, the super bulk foods, the great selection of ""Newman's Own"" right next to products that were made locally, and lunch/dinner options that include their great pre-made section (from sandwiches to tabbouleh salad) and their smoothie/sandwich/salad bar spot - everything was great.  My personal favorite, and new addiction, was their Cinnamon Sweet Potato and Corn Chips.  Freaking amazing. 

Here's the most important thing for everyone else to know.  When talking w/ that long term member I found out that they lost a huge chunk of their walk in traffic when they had to move to this new location.  They are hurting financially.  There's no massive corporation behind them to help them get through the rough spots, and no other valley location to help balance out the transition period at this location.  

Gentle Strength is a valley tradition to folks who love natural foods, or are living vegan or vegetarian.  With the popularity of this market, we now have Sprouts, Wild Oats and the others offering this same thing, and at locations that may be closer to you.  As you're able, I'd really hope that folks keep visiting Gentle Strength, because this is one piece of Valley history that we don't want to fade away.

No, wait... where are the 4,000 flavors of cheesecake? This IS the Cheesecake Factory, right??? No??? 

Okay, Grand Lux Cafe is so confusing. I think it is going through an identity crisis because it looks like a cross between a casino hotel lobby and The Cheesecake Factory, but without any personality. 

For dinner on a Wednesday night, in this great of a location, I was shocked to see this place so empty. Maybe everyone was across the street at Pink Taco. Or, maybe people just do not like being served by a wait staff with a perma-fake smile on their face all night. 

The one thing I will say for GLC is they have a LOT of options. However, I find restaurants that provide such a variety generally have anything exceptional to offer as far as the meal is concerned. I believe this is true for this establishment, as well. 

The waitress recommended the Vegetarian Chopped Salad saying she thought it was the best thing on the menu. I found it to be pretty bland and uninspiring. I guess I'm spoiled by the Cowboy Ciao Chopped Salad. But I digress. 

I would have gotten the tofu dish they have (orange glaze with sesame seeds, I believe) but I was informed that they cook it with a fish sauce. At least the waitress knew it was a non-veggie friendly option, but why serve a tofu dish that is not veggie? 

My dinner date ordered the BLT with fries. I think she ate about five bites and a couple of fries. She was equally unimpressed. I snuck a fry and they certainly are nothing to write home about. Limp and soggy, just the way nobody likes em. 

They did have a good Riesling a good selection of coffee drinks as well as an expansive dessert menu. We did not try a dessert (they have baked items that take about 30 minutes to cook.. probably pretty good, but I'm on a diet) but my gal pal did order a Mocha Coffee which she seemed relatively pleased with. 

We ended up sitting around chatting for 3.5 hours and they never kicked us out or made us feel bad about not ordering anything else, so I would give them an extra half star if I could (Gabi, are we EVER going to get half stars?!?!?).

Curry Leaf shares a strip mall with a dry cleaners, taco bell, AZ Hair Co and Chuck E Cheese. It's a small place with tables to eat in, but I imagine most of their business is takeout or the newly available delivery. 

Jeff P mentions ""It just sees as if some random Auntie and Uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast food versions of Indian food"" ... first of all, I disagree with this, and second, isn't America founded on the entrepreneurial spirit that promotes local owned businesses?!? 

Curry Leaf is owned by a husband/wife duo and I was super stoked at how nice the husband was. He answered my questions without prejudice which is rare for me in other Indian establishments. While I waited for my food, we chatted about their business, my business and other random chit chat. As I was leaving, another gentleman came in and the husband sang out ""Hey Bob, how are you doing today?!?"" It's nice to see that customer service and appreciation are still alive these days. 

I ordered the Channa Masala bowl with Basmati Rice and a side of Cumin Potatoes and I was really impressed. The flavor in both dishes was great and had just a little tinge of spicyness. The portions were great and for the price of $4.99 I think an excellent value (Lunch price is $4.99; regularly $6.99). 

There are also a couple of really neat things that make this place stand out: They offer deliver and TEXT IN service... so you can actually text them your order for pickup! I think that is such a cool idea. You are texting directly to the husbands phone, and then he saves your number so that in the future he knows that its you. I'm pretty sure he remembers every customer. 

The bowls that they use for takeout are very durable and can be used again as Tupperware. I think this is a super cool idea and adds a little value. 

In a world where we are cattle prodded through life eating out of Styrofoam containers in our cars, I believe Curry Leaf has made an attempt to add value to their product and I for one am both impressed and inspired and look forward to a new weekly lunch spot!",review,J7ZNnzbCoyMqd-y608wl6A

We came here around 10 or so and the place was pretty much full, and by full, I mean all 10 or so of their tables were occupied.  Fortunately, there were tables outside, so we grabbed one despite the clouds looming overhead.  

We sat there for a little while and enjoyed the cooler weather and perused the menus.  I was immediately turned off after noticing that almost everything on the menu contains onions.  Of course you can just ask for them to be removed, but for many people, they simply won't order something because of that.  We sat there for a while and the waitress finally came back to take our drink order, but specifically said we couldn't order our meal yet.  WTF, we're ready, and this is already taking long enough.  When she comes back out, entirely too much later, I ordered the starter which is two eggs, toast, and hashbrowns.  

Once our order was put in, we didn't see the waitress for another 30 minutes.  This is unacceptable for breakfast.  I was watching the window like a hawk and noticing the awfully slow rate at which food was going out to tables who were there well before we were.  The clouds decided to have some fun with us and began raining.  It got progressively worse until two of the outside tables went inside and stood, waiting for their food.  You'd think they would maybe expedite the food or something.  We stuck it out for about 5 more minutes and then gave up, realizing our food was never coming out.  We paid for the chocolate milk, and left.  The sad thing was, they didn't even do anything to rectify the situation.

This place is an absolute joke.  If you cannot handle the business you are receiving with the staff you have on hand, you need to hire more.  Not only that, but they need better servers.  The couldn't care less attitude of this place is pathetic.  I don't blame them one bit for the raining, and I certainly don't blame them one bit for being busy.  I do blame them for being careless and quite frankly, terrible at their jobs.

The shop is beautiful. 
The packaging is beautiful. 
The toffee is beautiful. 
Everything is beautiful. 

It is also expensive. 

I realize toffee is not an inexpensive product to make; but, I think a lot of the cost at GoodyTwos comes from the packaging -- which IS beautiful, but I would rather my gift giving dollar go toward the consumable treat. 

I did drive all the way out there so I couldn't bear to leave empty handed. I bought a small package of the double trouble and a small package of the 2 alarm peanut brittle as gifts. 

Personally, I think there's too much chocolate on the toffee - it's covered, top and bottom. Of course, I say that and then I go and buy the double trouble... but, hey! You might as well do it, if you're gonna go there! Right? Besides, peanut butter cups!?!

If you're unfamiliar with Chef Chu he's the proprietor of the hip and popular downtown Phoenix Asian tapas joint Sens. Now his dream is realized with the opening of Tien Wong Hot Pot. 

Surprisingly his new restaurant isn't even located in downtown Phoenix, but in the city of Chandler. After talking with Chef Chu on my last visit he explained to me that this location was selected to prove out his concept, in an Asian neighborhood. Low rent and a discerning customer base, he can make all the necessary tweaks for success and will hopefully bring Tien Wong to downtown in the future.

For many the whole hot pot experience might be foreign since many of us are used to having our food cooked for us, forget that. The idea of hot pot while romantic and interactive, is all about you cooking various meats and vegetables in hot pots filled with flavored broths. Each table is equipped with a high powered induction burner where you hot pot is placed, and then you order as many different raw meats, seafood, vegetables and noodles as you desire. 

Once our order started showing up I become overwhelmed and confused, where do you start? What are the cooking times? What do I do? Before allowing my head to explode, I simply took a breather and one of the helpful staff to my aid. In my calamity I didn't notice the helpful hints on the welcome card. However it goes something like this, the broth boils, you drop in the thinly sliced meats, pull out, dip into one of 2 sauces, sesame and soy, then eat, easy. After only a few minutes of practice it all came together into a well crafted experience that's designed for socializing, romance and lingering. 

If you have difficulty choosing your broth, opt for the Ying Yang Broth ($5.95) which includes both the house original herbal broth and the house spicy broth with the later being the most complex of the flavors I've tried. Starting with pork stock, the addition of dried dates, ginseng, Schezuan peppercorns and dried chiles give the base heat and depth. Over the course of your evening the broth evaporates with cooking which adds to the intensity and enjoyment.

Not to be confused with the tips of peas, Pea Tips ($4) actually are the leaves and stems surrounding the pea itself. The tips cook fast and have both crunchy and tender qualities that taste so good either cooked or raw. By contrast the Korean Pumpkin ($3) takes longer to cook but the payoff is so tender you can even eat the thin skin.

Noodles include springy Udon ($3) as well as a Flat Rice Noodle ($3) which resemble chewy flat pieces of rice than a noodle in the traditional sense. Both cook up in a hurry and their absorbent properties are capable for taking in so much flavor. 

Sliced Wagyu Beef ($8) comes from one of the best breeds of cattle in the world. So its no surprise that the meat was flavorful and tender. Add an order of Lobster ($9), if available, for a surf and turf combo. Names aren't always accurate descriptions, take Sliced Black Pork ($4) which isn't black at all, the name refers to the pigs breed since it has black hair and skin. It's super tender and flavorful only taking a few seconds to cook thanks to expert slicing. 

Desserts feature 2 different kind of cheesecake, Strawberry ($6) and Green Tea ($6), both were light and satisfying, the perfect ending to Chef Chu's dream.",review,28ycqW56i70yM_C0ejNv9w

Healthy food, a menu that changes seasonally, and weekly specials based on what the restaurant can buy fresh. But the beauty of the concept's theory leads to its big downfall. The food is not bad, but it's also not very memorable. Everything on the menu is under 475 calories. That's great considering most restaurant entrees usually are closer to the thousands, but it also leaves you yearning for more flavor. 

We started with the garlic chicken flatbread. It was pretty good. Very garlicky. But Seasons 52 is supposed to be ""known"" for its flatbread. If this is one of the chain's signature dishes, I really would've hoped for more. We had the Salmon and Halibut as entrees. Both were cooked perfectly and had a decent taste. But both plates consisted of fish surrounded by vegetables. It just looked and felt like a bunch of stuff thrown on a plate. I could've done this at home with very little effort. Maybe if the vegetables were pureed and made into a sauce, then this would've have felt like it was worth paying to go out. I'll give Seasons 52 one thing; dessert was awesome. We had the chocolate peanut butter moose and key lime pie. Desserts are put in generous sized shot glasses and only cost $2.50. Hard to say no to that! 

The decor is a little out of place to me. It feels like the ambiance is trying too hard to tell you that this place is high class. The brick and fireplace look screams steakhouse, and doesn't really fit with a theme that you are eating lighter, healthier meals. I don't know how Seasons 52's other locations are decorated, but unless this is a consistent look, it's almost as if the place is trying to justify that it's in the Biltmore. 

The waiter was pretty good. Brett was honest about dishes he liked and didn't like. He also had a lot of energy and was always around to promptly clear plates and refill drinks. Sometimes it actually felt like he was sticking too close to our table. 

I didn't hate Seasons 52. I like the idea behind it, but there's lots of room for improvement. If you're looking to stick to your diet, but not in the mood to cook, then its worth a try. But there's too many good restaurants in and around the Biltmore for me to want to rush right back.",review,-h-q6zTIdPlkz9BDP11sBg

The owner is a great guy and even if they seem a little preoccupied, don't be afraid to ask questions of the staff - they are more than willing to help you find something or even order something special for you. 

These days it's so easy to order things on the internet and stores like this go away. Stores like Wal Mart and Best Buy don't help the situation either. They can't really keep up price-wise, but they will have stuff you won't be able to find elsewhere. It's a great place to go to find new music you never heard of before and to find stuff you thought didn't exist or was out of print.

Some of the items on the menu are just OK but the real stars are the appetizers.  Our favorites are the nachos and the hummus.  Either of these could easily be a meal in and of themselves.  If you do order an entree you usually can't go wrong with whatever the daily special is.  Also, all the pizzas and burgers that we have tried have been really yummy.  But my favorite things to order are the grilled cheese or street tacos.  The servers are all very knowledgeable of the menu and also passionate about the beer.  They can make good recommendations on both fronts if you tell them what your preferences are and can usually offer ideas on pairings.

This place has a very chill vibe during the day.  It is a great spot for some relaxing day drinking, especially in the spring or fall when they roll up the big ice house style doors... so creating that inside, outside feeling.  They do have a kids menu but I have never seen any families here no matter what time it is.  Usually in the afternoon it is couples of all ages grabbing a bite while enjoying some shopping in downtown Chandler or else groups of friends just hanging out.  At night, it gets much more lively.  They frequently have a band or DJ starting at 10pm or so but even before that it can get so loud that it is difficult to carry on a conversation.  That is probably my only complaint about this place.  The concrete floors and lots of hard surfaces make the acoustics horrible.  Usually in the late evenings you will see more large, sometimes rowdy groups of 30-somethings occupying the tables and lots of singles of both genders milling around the bar.  Often on Friday or Saturday nights it is standing room only unless you call ahead for a table.  The servers are usually nice enough to bring drinks to those in the hostess area, so if you do get stuck waiting for a table it is not so bad.  They also use a smart system of taking your cell number instead of giving you a pager.  So, you can wander around the shops down the street instead, if you so desire, without fear of going out of range.

My quest for Indian food in the valley continues. Call me spoiled but I have had some GREAT Indian food (on and off a buffet) and everything after that is relative. I also learned to make a few of my favorite dishes for those times I lived in the boonies and couldn't easily get my Indian fix. 

Craving Indian food for Sunday brunch, I recall a restaurant that many of my friends have tried and enjoyed, Royal Taj. 
Popped in just after noon, its not busy. The ambiance is warm and cozy. I request a booth and decide on the buffet. It is small but contains the standard fare, basmati rice, saag paneer, a lentil (dal) dish, a chickpea dish, veggie pakora, masala paneer, chicken tikka masala, chicken vindaloo and tandori chicken. A sign above the buffet says that Garlic Naan will be served at the table. 

Picking up my large plate and put rice at the center and put a little of just about everything around the outside to try. As I served the saag paneer I noticed I didn't see the chunks of paneer I often do with this dish (maybe they blend it in). Plate full and serving myself up a cup of warm chai (included at the buffet) I sat back at my booth. Shortly there after my naan arrives HOT and fresh. I pull apart a piece, crispy on the outside and soft interior. The garlic not as prominent as I would have liked, but as I would find out soon the naan was the main redeeming quality about Royal Taj. Five stars for the naan!! 

The rest of the food was lack luster, not bad just not that good even by Phx standards, the pakora were stale and the masalas thin. My relative favorites from this buffet were the chicken vindaloo, the saag paneer and the chickpea dish. These were seasoned well, although I missed the chunks of paneer in the saag. 
They had 2 of my most favorite desserts on the buffet, kheer (sweet rice) and the gulab jamun (pastry balls in a cardamon honey syrup). The kheer appeared strangely thick, but I didn't think much when serving it. When I finally got to the table and had a bite....did they use yogurt or buttermilk?

The staff and volunteers at the DBG do an excellent job of directing guests through the garden. Between the well-lit paths (with Luminarias of course), helpful staff and amazing acts, this is an event not to be missed! I consider this to be the ultimate activity for adults. It's romantic if you're on a date, it's festive if you're with your family and it's just pure fun if you're with friends. 

You enter the park to be immediately greeted by hundreds of meowganificant Luminarias lighting up the entire garden. Cocktail stations lie in every knook and cranny and they serve delicious festive drinks like my favorite, hot cocoa and raspberry vodka! If you're hungry, they sell food throughout the garden at two locations. Then there are the performers. The DBG does an amazing job of bringing in musicians of every shape and size. Whether it's a trio of Christmas carolers, a mariachi band or a lively Jazz band, they have bands in every corner lighting up the night! I am also continuously impressed with the acoustics of the garden. With so many live acts in one area, you can barely hear a specific act until you are in that area. Their event planners did an amazing job!

They were able to see me SAME DAY, which was an awesome treat. I was afraid I would have to wait several days for my new puppy exam and the medical guarantee from the breeder was only good for one week.

Anyways, the vets office was conveniently located, the office is clean, the staff is friendly and everyone was in love with Penny. (it's hard not to be.. I know I am a proud mommy, but she really is adorable!)

I sat down and filled out my paperwork and they took me back right away. The vet, Dr. Temple, was extremely friendly and thorough and answered all my questions. I signed up for the ""puppy package"" that basically takes you through all of the shots they need for the first few months, wellness exams, fecal test and a microchip and also includes a start up of heartworm preventer.

Penny had her second set of shots the day prior when I purchased her from the breeder, but for some reason Dr. Temple gave her another set. She told me there was nothing to worry about but they didn't charge me, so I think she may have made a mistake. Penny was fine and she told me that it would not cause any problems, but I'm glad that she didn't make a mistake on something life threatening. (This is the only reason I am not giving ACHS five stars.)

We went back three weeks later for our third set of shots and got in immediately. They were quick, friendly and efficient again and able to provide me with some suggestions on how to curb Miss Penny's biting habits.

The only issues I have encountered were with the billing. I think that the puppy package confuses the billing girls a little, because both times I went in they had to make adjustments. Not a big deal, they took care of everything and refunded the incorrect amount immediately, I just hope it doesn't keep happening.

Oh, another really cool feature is that your pet gets a login and you can keep track of service records through the vet. They have some cool features on the website where you can fill out forms for someone babysitting your pet and you can post pictures and put in information about the diet. I know I lose papers all the time, so its great to have all of Penny's records online where I can easily access them.

They have awesome hours... so I can get in after work, and the location is convenient for me. They also sell different types of food and hygiene supplies there, so you can pick up stuff for your animal should you need to.

I would definitely recommend this Vet's office to anyone. Knowledgeable and Friendly staff!",review,QEgP-kDuXD2fQJHBm3HoFw

Pavle told me I had to wait another 15 minutes.  Thought I'd head over to Truckin' Good Food and place my order, since a crepe normally takes 12 to 15 minutes to prepare due to all of the people lining up for their fix of French delights.  (I also thought that if I limited the time I had to check out the various vendors and their wares, that I could save myself some $$!  The last time I visited, I spend around $44!)  Some of these vendors are sneaky, though, apppealing to my sweet tooth, so I just HAD to sample a vendor's (sorry I didn't get the name!) Espresso Almond brittle (may get some on my next visit!) and the three toffee varieties (almond, dark chocolate and seasalt, and hazelnut) that GoodyTwos had on display.  Loved the toffees so much, that I bought two quarter-pound bags of the almond and hazelnut, although I loved the dark chocolate one w/ the same intensity as the other two!  Purchase total thus far?  $15.  Oof!  I better get myself to T'GF, stat!

No Brittany crepe today again.  :(  Jeff explained that he didn't have access to the buckwheat honey anymore.  In fact, he didn't know where the vendor went.  That's too bad.  I hope Jeff finds another supplier soon-- I counted two honey vendors there this morning, but I didn't stop to ask if they offered buckwheat...  W/ the absence of the Brittany, I was stuck w/ ordering ""My First Time,"" which really isn't a negative, as today's version was well-prepared!  Really loved the crunch that the walnuts added (my previous serving lacked walnuts-- Jeff had just run out) to the Nutella and banana goodness!  Breakfast crepe= $5.

While waiting for my crepe, I wandered over to Moms Gone Nuts and tried the roasted cinnamon almonds and cashews (other varieties incl. walnuts, pecans, and even one spiced w/ jalapenos and ""smart sugar,"" a processed white cane sugar that makes for a lighter finished product that doesn't require as much sugar to coat the nuts).  I bought a bag each of the almonds and cashews= $9.

Last, but not least, I had to get my ration of zaatar bread and hummus (will provide vendor name later), which cost $11 (the cost of the bread went up from $5 to $6).  

Total cost this Saturday morning?  $40!  That blows my theory (see above) out of the park, but I really don't mind, since the money went in support of local businesses.  I love it when I have some free time during my most-favorite part of the day to enjoy beautiful weather outdoors, have a wonderful breakfast, and meet new people!

p.s.  Almost forgot!  Went back to FnB and found a line of people also waiting to get their hands on those freshly-made donuts, so I too fell in line.  This gave me a chance to watch Charleen in action, quickly making those Roasted Chicken Tortas, w/ bean spread and chipotle mayo on ciabatta bread ($10).  These looked so good, I almost wanted to get one for Mom to try!  Maybe next time.  Those brownies w/ pecans and figs ($2 each) looked really great, as well, but I have to stay away from pecans.  :(  Might as well, as this morning's excursion was expensive!  Five donuts (and donut holes), $5.  

Out the door damages?  $45.  Darn it!!

I was not disappointed. This restaurant design and layout is as fantastic as the food and service. 

The Spot: 
Located on 1st and Camelback this gorgeous building boasts original brick walls and polished concrete floors downstairs. I had inquired about the upstairs and my server let me sneak a peak, the floor upstairs is made of cork, very unique and gorgeous. The contemporary design really stands out. There is a support system of cable and pin settings, which do away with support columns (so said my dining partner), and it creates a very open and airy flow.  The women's restroom has an original safe built in to the wall with the handle acting as a toilet paper roll. The bar opens to both the restaurant and the patio so giving diners a sense of comfort. There are also pop out windows, so you are able to see in to the kitchen from almost any spot. Currently only the downstairs is open, with plans to open the upstairs within a few months. (The upstairs would be a great place to have a big birthday dinner, seating about 40). The patio wraps around the restaurant and will provide additional seating once the weather cools off a bit.

The Chef:
Aaron Chamberlin was part of the opening team for some of my favorite restaurants in the valley: Chelsea's Kitchen, LGO and Radio Milano. He has over 20 years of experience and his French/Mediterranean training helps him to create phenomenal dishes, with top quality ingredients. The kitchen has a brick chamber used for roasting meats, vegetables and breads. The oven and selected spices really brought out the flavor in each dish. 

The Food:
The menus will change seasonally to take advantage of the ripest produce Arizona has to offer. The current menu incorporates local ingredients such as Arizona pistachios, honey and goat cheese from Black Mesa Ranch. St. Francis is one of only a handful of restaurants that are able to use rare herbs from Sonoma. 

Last night I started with the baked goat cheese with walnut herb pesto and toasted bread, it was absolutely delicious. The cheese and walnuts were so fresh I had to go easy not to ruin my appetite for dinner.  For my main I had the pepper-crusted flat iron steak with creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes covered in a red wine reduction.  The steak was phenomenal; it was so tender I could cut it with a fork. I was also pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed the creamed spinach.

Desert was also amazing; I went with the summer fruit trifle as it seemed a lighter dish. It had strawberries, peaches, raspberries and some other berry I couldn't nail down, all surrounded in a light cream topped with toasted almonds. It was heaven.

The Service: 
The server was awesome. She explained the philosophy of the restaurant along with the vision of the chef. She was quick to point out her favorite meals and her parents were seated next to us. It was nice to see so many friends and family in a newly opened spot. 

This place will become a part of my regular restaurant rotation in CenPho. Quality ingredients, wonderful layout and educated staff make this a 5 star review.",review,uKSX1n1RoAzGq4bV8GPHVg

2) I think I'll make a point to see a movie here once a month, starting with Juno when it begins playing here. This is the kind of pact every one should make. 

3) If you've never been to this theatre, you're doing yourself a disservice. You should be kinder to yourself. Seriously. Go check out Valley Art Theatre today.",review,Zu93JuSKbponnD3Mx5zpEg

 However, this time some 20 year old idiot host walked us to our table (and before we even sat down) and told us ""My mom taught me good manners, so I've always taken my hat off at the dinner table.""  

Huh?  First of all, I was dressed nicely in a button up shirt, and was wearing my favorite football team hat who had just won the championship the day before.  Secondly, I hadn't even sat down at the table yet, asswipe.  Thirdly, while I understand this isn't Applebees, this also isn't Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, douche bag.  And don't talk to me like I'm 7 years old.

No sooner had the idiot host left before we walked into the kitchen to get the manager  to bitch him out about his insulting employee.  The manager was pretty much dismissive.  Well, guess what - I'm pretty much dismissive about this poor excuse for a restaurant.

We met a couple friends here and when we walked in, I loved the decor.  It looks just like the inside of my house with the bright colored walls and the exposed brick and ductwork.  Unfortunately, my love for this place stops there.  We decided to order the Plaintain Avocado Spring rolls.  Taste wise, these were okay on the first bite, the more you ate, the less distinguishable the flavors got.  It was really just a big mess of mush inside a soggy wonton type wrapper.  The dipping sauce was tasty though.

I ordered the Jerk Shrimp and it came with a side of rice and beans.  The tails were removed from the shrimp, which was really nice to not have to take care of myself.  Unfortunately the shrimp were not cooked very well.  They were quite tough and had this weird crispiness to them.  The flavor on the shrimp was ridiculously overpowering.

I couldn't taste anything besides the spice, even after downing my entire bottle of pineapple soda, which was way too sugary.  Everyone else's food looked decent, but overcooked.

My favorite part honestly is the archway between the restaurant and the gift shop.  It is a giant fish tank.  No animatronic fish here.   Real fish.  And it's pretty freaking cool.  But the star it might gain from that it immediately loses for the prices.  Just like many theme restaurants, they are overcharging you for the food.

That was one of my friends' hypothesis. I thought it was a good one. But I also theorize that there is some element of the crowd that is influenced by the Vig's proximity to Paradise Valley, which is only 4 minutes away (for those who don't know, PV is Phx's residential answer to Beverly Hills; many celebrities who move here live in PV). Hollywoodus donchawannabelikeus?

So yeah, you might not fit in with this crowd but why should that stop you? By 7 or 8 o'clock, the Vig was completely hopping with good music and tons of people packed inside having fun, including us. We didn't try the food because the reviews seem to have torn that aspect to shreds. But the happy hour beers were 3 bucks each and appetizers were half off. What's wrong with that?

EDIT: One warning. The parking. Three bucks to valet, and I still have no idea where you would park for free to avoid that on a crowded night. Maybe across the street in the Basha's parking lot?",review,FqzgT9Y-Yu7jiWdHnGW-kQ

* Water is served in plastic cups

* The bread is 'eh and costs you $3
* the bruschetta is just ok
* The fresh mozzarella is awesome
* The pasta is fresh and delicious
* The tiramisu is fresh, fluffy, creamy and delicious

The best part about this place is the owner, Richard Bock.  Although he jokes around and is super friendly, you can tell he knows what he is doing when it comes to his food and his restaurant.  From the prices he charges to the way he pushes the higher priced menu items, you can tell he is a sucker for the bottom line.

Check it.

I couldn't resist folks. I HAD to see what a Fresh & Easy was all about. However, I walked into this store having not eaten for the previous 6 hours. I was STARVING. Grown man hungry in bachelor-friendly grocery store. This is not good, my friends.

I walked around the aisles and just started throwing things in my shopping cart, as if I was some rabid animal or something. Frozen F&E-brand chicken makhani? Sure. F&E almond butter? OK! Regular and fire roasted pepper hummus? Yes and Yes! F&E brand whole wheat roti? Yes, roti! That is kickass on a whole new level. Sodium-free cans of black beans for only $0.50? Sure! I also discovered in this store that Land O' Lakes, purveyors of that butter with Pocahontas on the box, makes lactose-free milk! WTF? And its regular price of $3.02 is way cheaper than lactose-free milk (ie Lactaid) at Trader Joe's and the same price as club-priced Lucerne lactose-free milk at Safeway. Not that any of you besides Bonnie G cares about this fact, but  you know now anyway. 

Fresh & Easy has a mix of company-branded items along with a lot of regular brands of just about everything, so you're not stuck with the choice of two shampoos like at Trader joe's. So for a guy like me, this place is like heaven-sent, and F&E really has upped the stakes for a place like Trader Joe's. Bakery section included a lot of traditional Mexican pastries, which caught me by surprise. 

However, no place is ever perfect, and Fresh & Easy has a few flaws. 

1) Cereal - Most of the selection is your regular post and general mills stuff and none of my favorites were there (vs Trader Joe's and Sprouts). The F&E-branded cereal is limited to granola or cornflakes/raisin bran.

2) Ready to eat meals at the deli - A lot of the bowls in the fridge looked really appetizing to this hungry fool, but then I turned the bowl over the Pad Thai to look at the nutritional content. 1018 calories for 1 serving. Holy shit!

3) Produce. Everything apart from the bananas is pre-packaged. Which is fine, except when it comes to serrano chiles, they only had packages of one serrano chile with one jalapeno and one yellow chile pepper. What the hell is that? What am I or is anyone else going to do with just one of each pepper? Not sure.

I asked the folks working the demonstration counter when any of the locations in Phoenix proper were opening. They all said that the 12th St & Northern Ave location will probably be the next to open, so stay tuned for that. But will Fresh & Easy completely cancel me going out to Sprouts or Trader Joe's or Safeway? Doubt it. But it sure as hell will make things a lot more convenient.

In the meantime, I have to figure out what the hell I just spent $87 on.

This way the miners didn't eat the dirt they were covered in, missing out on ingesting stuff like arsenic that was common in the mines. While most tin mining is gone, we're fortunate to have the Cornish Pasty Co., which specializes in pasties.

With restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, each location has its own spirit. While both are laid back, the Tempe location has a more subdued feel with dim lighting and no windows. Mesa has a brighter interior with indie rock blaring over the sound system.

If you enjoy watching kitchen action, belly up to the bar at either locale for a first-hand look into the hard work that goes into making their delicious pasties.

As soon as I entered the Tempe location, the warm smell of wine gravy and fresh baked crust covered me like a blanket of mouth-watering comfort. The feeling was like going home for the holidays. I know it's a million degrees outside, but the feeling transcends the summer heat.

The first pasty I tried, The Pilgrim ($8), exemplified everything that tastes good at Thanksgiving, luscious turkey breast, sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions all wrapped in a tender crust, then served with a side of cranberry sauce. After one bite, I felt like I needed to pay thanks to someone.

The Porky ($7) is filled with all that is good: pork, apples, potatoes, onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy. The problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty I'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it.

Never able to resist a good burger, I decided to take a chance with the Royale with Cheese ($7.50). Ordered medium, this pasty was brimming with a juicy hamburger, French fries and cheese and served with a side of Thousand Island dressing. As the meat juices ran down my face, I couldn't help but think of the scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta explains to Samuel Jackson what the name of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is in Amsterdam.

The Peanut Butter and Jelly ($5) was served piping hot. One bite of this was not going to be enough. Filled with creamy peanut butter, raspberry preserves and sliced banana, the sweet goodness oozed out after the first cut was made. The plate was expertly cleaned in mere moments.

Cornish Pasty Co. has a small, but great, beer selection, including one of my favorites, Kronenbourg 1664. Plus visit during their daily happy hour from 3-5pm and you'll enjoy a buck off of every pint.",review,WNy1uzcmm_UHmTyR--o5IA

Came by to use up the rest of my CSM gift card since the market is set to close this Saturday at 5p.  Everything in the store, besides what were offered in the deli and fresh-prepared, were 25% off.  Already, the store looked like it was running on fumes-- 1/3 to 1/2 of the shelves stocked, and not much food in the deli cases, and almost-barren pastry case.  Produce aisle was almost empty.  There were still a few bottles of AZ wine left.  If I hadn't made it a point to only drink organic and/or sustainable wines a few months ago, I'd have walked out with a few bottles...

For sustenance, I ordered a bit of the pasta, quinoa, and sweet potato salads, and I enjoyed it very much!  Loved the lemon-herb vinaigrette used in the quinoa salad.  The pasta was perfect in texture and bite, and not too greasy.  The sweet potatoes were terrific!  Not mushy or too sweet.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o9ncq8xQo_hd427lMsQQZw?select=Z7R54ZSL8VU0YtBHDD5LFQ#Z7R54ZSL8VU0YtBHDD5LFQ  Since I was trying to use up my gift card, I decided to order two sandwiches to try a few bites out of and then box the rest up for leftovers.  LOVED the Smoke Shop (?) bacon used-- very meaty, and not too much fat gristle to trim!  Delicious!  I also enjoyed the aioli very, very much.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o9ncq8xQo_hd427lMsQQZw?select=mFz_yas6nZ2eyApYuZBCzA#mFz_yas6nZ2eyApYuZBCzA  The toasted multi-grain bread had great crunch factor.  :))  The ""Friggin' chicken"" sandwich was very good, as well.  Very spicy due to the jalapenos, but the sweetness of the mango chutney, together with the cheese, helped cut the spice down.  Really, really liked the bun!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o9ncq8xQo_hd427lMsQQZw?select=ixW9ez-QJfjgcqqM0bDeIQ#ixW9ez-QJfjgcqqM0bDeIQ  However, the a la carte pricing was a bit too steep.  However, knowing everything is local and sometimes organic kind of helps...

While the grocery/wine bar is closing, the Wednesday night and Saturday morning markets will still go on.  Tonight's crowd outdoors was a bit saddening, though.  Perhaps the sudden thunder and lightning storm that just dissipated a few minutes before I parked had something to do with the lack of activity, but it almost seemed like those present were there for a funeral...

Since I've tried and loved goats' milk ice cream and cheese, I decided to take a chance and purchased two Black Mesa Ranch (Snowflake, AZ; 928-536-7759) products, Goats Milk Caramel Fudge Sauce and Goats Milk Caramel Sauce, at $9.50 a piece (minus 25% closing-shop discount).  I may use these items as dips and ice cream toppings, and however else they may inspire me!  ;)  I'm having some of the caramel sauce with banana as part of my breakfast (whole wheat pan de sal, a slice of Breadsmith sesame seed-encrusted rustic Italian bread, organic banana, Maranatha organic crunchy and roasted almond butter, and organic coffee!), and I had to take this time to write about how wonderfully delicious it is.  I first notice the exquisite caramel flavor and the buttery-silk texture, and the scent of goats' milk is in the background.  I'd say that, unless you truly abhor the taste/scent of goats' milk, novices and lovers of goats' milk products will enjoy this caramel offering!  I've yet to try the caramel fudge sauce, but as soon as I do, I will definitely add to this review.",review,Ax11wyp-FudujeU9nejQbw

I love Alice Cooper. But it's very obvious to me that Alice no longer has anything to do with this place other than slapping his name on the signs out front. He obviously doesn't manage it himself. I have to believe that, because no one as great as Alice would be associated with as mediocre an effort as this.

The food has really begun to get pretty crappy. The place is always closed. It has so much potential and is in such a great location, but Alice has just gotten so lazy, complacent, and uncreative about it that it's no longer worth associating my good name to it.

When my Sticky Bun was delivered to my table I couldn't help but stare into the caramel covered abyss. I wondered if I could get the whole thing into my mouth at once? What was I thinking?

Every Phoenician should go here at least once.  So, last Friday night as a monsoon was ""supposed"" to roll in, we decided to pay the Rooste a visit.

The parking lot at the top was full so we parked at the bottom.  I wouldn't have minded the walk up but they have a shuttle that will take you so that was nice.  I guess the best way to describe this place is a big western saloon with an awesome view of the city.  Maybe ""saloon"" doesn't do it much justice but it is all I could think of.  It is just very westerny.

The place was pretty packed but we didn't mind because it would give us time to check out the place and maybe sit at the bar and get an ice cold Shiner that is on tap.  Well we tried that while waiting for a table but it looked like there was only one bar tender getting drinks for the bar patrons as well as the entire waitstaff for all the tables in the place.  Oh well.  After a few minutes were were seated and yes, we both took the slide down.  Oh, there was also a live band playing some country music and it was pretty good and not overly loud.  If I had a couple more drinks in my I probably would have tried to dance country style. 

Our waiter was very nice but some things took forever because the poor guy had like 17 tables.  I don't understand why places can't hire more waitstaff.  I mean they work basically for tips and there are probably plenty of people wanting jobs so wtf?  Anyway, he was very nice and did the best job he could.

I love the Indian fry bread and biscuits they give you to start.  I could eat that stuff all night.  They give you like 3 different kinds of butter and honey to play with so it doesn't get much better than that.

My wife and I split the bone in rib eye and it was juicy, flavorful and delicious.  It was a bit fatty but that is how I like it.  My wife took the less marbled part so it all worked out.  With an entree you get a nice big salad, beans and corn.  It was all good and was plenty for 2 people.  I would definitely order the steak again but I think next time we are going to share some of their ribs.  I had them years ago and I remember them being very good.

I know some people like it, especially the kids, but I don't like the random guys walking around making balloon animals and others doing magic tricks.  I try not to make eye contact with them so they don't come over because I just want to sit and enjoy my meal.

Anyway, this place is pretty good and perfect to bring out-of-towners because it is very westerny and has a perfect view.  Kids also seem to love the balloon animals, magic, the slide, and the little paper bull horn hats they give them.  Also, when you go, I would recommend sharing your entree.  The amount of meat they give you is more than enough for 2 people.

I've dined a few times at Arizona Grand's restaurants, many of them now gone (Latitude 30 and The Phantom Horse Grill).  The Lobby Grill is a smaller version of TPHG- same furnishings, different location.  I'd have eaten here earlier if I could've found it-- just follow the signs until it seems you've gone too far, and you're almost there!  Don't worry about finding parking spaces-- it may look like a long walk, but it's really just around the corner, down the ""hill.""  

There was a little confusion as it seemed that the main dining room was closed and seating was only at the bar, but the host was nice enough to let us sit at a booth; This was a relief, as it looked cold and dark inside the bar, and warm and bright inside the main room.  Service was a bit slow, despite the facts that there was only a family of three (one was a toddler) seated before us, and I'd already perused through the menu online-- I knew what I wanted to try!  (Oh, how I'd rejoice when the day comes where I can place my order online so that it would be ready to serve when I am seated!)

We ordered the Filet bleu cheese pizza and the Reinvented Waldorf salad.  This order took awhile (35-40 minutes!) to arrive, so it would be in your best interests to bring something to read if you're dining alone, or if the members of your group aren't into small talk.  Thankfully, there's a gift shop across the hall!  As far as resort gift shops go, this isn't shabby at all.  It even carries Brighton jewelry!  Be warned, their inventory doesn't carry the newer items you'll find at the mall.  But I'm not here to talk about silver watches...

The place wasn't very crowded and the waitress told us to sear ourselves and she quickly brought menus and got our drinks.  They had Coke instead of Pepsi, so I was happy.
We started with this cajun shrimp app.  It was basically jambalaya without the rice.  It came with some toasted bread and was really amazing.  I would have rather just had jambalaya but this was a good starter.  I would order it again in a heartbeat.  It was about $12 though, which seems high for an app but it had about 8 very large shrimp in it so I guess I feel like I got my money's worth.
Then I had a burger that was actually topped with pulled pork and cheese.  This was one of the stranger things on the menu so I had to try it.  The burger, by itself, wasn't very good.  It was cooked more medium-well than medium and was pretty flavorless.  The pork, however, was excellent.  There wasn't nearly enough bbq sauce to make the whole thing work though.

We ordered the chicken fajitas and a Mexican salad. Both were good, but nothing to really rave about.

Maria Maria seemed like more hype than substance to me.

What is with people bringing young children into a place like this? The decor should be a hint that this is not a McDonald's playland. The rule I heard awhile back that stuck with me is ""that the menu price should match the childs age"". For example at McDonalds you can get a kids meal for under $3... good for 3-year olds and up. At Denny's you can eat for about $10, and at a place like Maria Maria a really cheap bastard can get away with about $15. What a simple and elegant formula for parents to follow...

Shitty bar with shitty bar food. There are tons of video games, but honestly I'd rather play with my Xbox 360. It's a nice idea and people from my generation who grew up with arcades being a normal thing should be thankful they have a place to go that isn't golfland or chucky cheese or peter piper pizza - but seriously, this place is uncool and lame. Nothing hip about it. Granted, I went around 4pm on a weekday...

The games aren't anything special either. And worst of all, when I went the place was packed with kids. Fuck you, take your stupid asshole kids somewhere else so they can get their filthy booger-laiden sticky fingers on games I'm not going to touch. Chucky Cheese is your place, you dick... hell, they serve beer at Peter Piper too - so take em there instead. You're probably the same cunts that take your noisy retard kids to an R rated movie at 10pm.  

You know, once when I was like 19 I went to Chucky Cheese with some friends because we thought it would be fun to relive our youth and such and we got thrown out because we didn't have kids with us... they should throw kids out of this fucking place. It's only fair.

The concept of D & B as I understand it is to give adults a place to play games and drink and whatnot. Poorly executed I think. Even the prize shop where you cash in your tickets (super lame idea to incorporate into such a place) had lame prizes.

I dated a girl for awhile who had friends that liked to go to Jillians on occasion. They were fucking dorks and that place was lame... Dave and Busters is lamer. Maybe I'm jaded because I miss the old glory days of arcades and pool halls... plus, I've been to E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) 5 times and that's pretty much like a Dave and Busters that's about 1000 times cooler and that takes up the entire Staples Center in LA. 

Just think about all the most sophisticated video games and technology that hasn't been released to the public yet under one giant roof - they give you free shit and let you play games - celebritys show up - hot model girls dressed in slutty video game costumes pretend to like you - famous bands play live sets - the military shows up and shows off new high tech gear - and they usually have a half pipe where famous skaters do a skate demo. 

After that, I guess it takes a lot to impress me. Dave and Busters won't cut it. Actually - I would've thought Dave and Busters was lame before I ever went to E3.. probably.

This Valle Luna location is in a strip mall which has definitely seen better days (as goes for much of its immediate surroundings). However, inside ain't so bad. 

Very dimly lit, I was taken to a dining room and given a sizeable booth while I waited for my colleagues. I looked around - it was amiable enough and I was given a glass of water and asked if I wanted to start off with a cheese crisp. The waitress looked confused when I laughed while saying ""no"" but to be fair, she doesn't know the three act play which is my digestive system.

I then kept looking around and saw that the sole TV in the room was tuned to Fox News. Fox News? Listening to blowhards while eating lunch in a restaurant? Minus a star.  

My colleagues eventually arrived and we ordered. One got the chicken burro, another some grilled fish dish, another got grilled veggie fajitas (although because this is a ""Sonoran"" restaurant they're not called fajitas but something else which I promptly forgot) and I got the sizzling chicken not-called-fajitas fajitas. The waitress was very accomodating in ensuring that my dish and its accompaniments were de-lactosed, scoring extra guac instead of sour cream.

When the entrees arrived I already had my mind made up that this was going to be run of the mill food. Nothing spectacular, but nothing that bad either. I filled up my flour tortilla (no corn - minus a point) with black beans, rice, chicken (with grilled onions & bell peppers), guac and a little salsa. Almost all the fajita ingredients were as I expected: nothing spectacular. 

But the chicken? Hot damn. That was good. Not just good, GREAT. Blew Chili's chicken fajitas right out of the water. Whatever spices these guys used did the trick. Extremely savory and mouth-watering. And the grilled onions put In N' Out to shame. It was just too bad that everything else the chicken came with was not nearly as memorable.

They officially opened yesterday and they are still celebrating the official grand opening this weekend.  We stopped by this morning to find lots of passionate business owners and employees, fellow shoppers, and some food, drink, and entertainment as well.

UNION is made up of 18 small boutiques ranging in size from 200-500 square feet, as well as the new casual eatery, Trattoria del Piero. It's located at the east end of the outdoor shopping mall, right next door to Stingray.  

We had our toddler with us, so I couldn't do as much shopping as I would've liked today, but I'll definitely be back to explore in more detail.  In the meantime, some highlights for me included seeing several fabulous women's boutiques near the front that I didn't catch the names of; a small storefront for Customatic.com, which offers all kinds of custom pieces for the modern home; Smeeks which sells an assortment of old-time favorite candy and fun unique gifts - my son was in heaven looking around at everything there; Frances which just like their original location sells everything from women's clothing, shoes, accessories, and more; Oils and Olives by Queen Creek Olive Mill, which is pretty self-explanatory,and Paris Envy which has all kinds of vintage home decor items, accessories, and more.  

In addition, there is a flower shop, a bicycle company, a newsstand and paper-goods storefront, Royal Coffee, etc... Like I said, I can't wait to go back without my kid to shop more peacefully and take my time checking it all out!

We did grab a quick meal at Trattoria del Piero, which has an impressive menu and serves local, organic food / drinks all day long including casual breakfast and lunch, and more of a full service restaurant in the evenings for dinner.  We had a breakfast frittata sandwich that reminded me of tortilla espanola from my studies abroad in Spain years ago... it was delicious!  We also had a P, B & J sandwich with banana and some mini chocolate cupcakes made with Queen Creek Olive Mill's olive oil - all very tasty!

Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.

Here's my take on this place:
For $12.50 you get a platter full of diced shrimp ceviche bordered by at least a dozen grilled regular sized shrimp and no less that a whole avocado's worth of wedges. It's served with crisp, flat, tostada chips and is plenty to share! A real value!!

If I'm dining alone, I generally get a couple of pupusas. Pupusas are like thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans or meat - your pick! They even offer a version stuffed with the loroco flower, which I understand is similar to a squash blossom. Myself? I'm a bean and cheese girl most of the time. And, I prefer them straight up: skip the tomato sauce and slaw topping. 

The chicken soup is flavorful and the portion size is significant, served with a couple of handmade tortillas.

Salvadoreno recently got a beer and wine license, and, a I can't think of a better beverage to wash down a pupusa than an ice cold beer!

Oh! I guess this can be my ""scoop"" - Salvadoreno is going to start offering a $7.95 lunch buffet from 11 - 3. Buffet items will vary depending on the day of the week.  I'm feelin' a pupusa eating contest as a lunchtime UYE!",review,cNGI_5GbfNFbZBMQZ-s-UQ

It's no big secret that I'm a huge fan of Chris Bianco. His simple honest to goodness approach to food is not only inspiring but down right delicious. If you're one of his fans who don't mind waiting 4 hours for one of his amazing pies at Pizzeria Bianco, then you're in for a real treat. While they don't serve pizza, one of my all time favorites, Pane Bianco is now serving dinner and no serious wait either! In addition to ordering one of their famous sandwiches, you can expect an ever changing menu of rustic Italian inspired plates.

If you've been to Pane you know the drill, go in, order at the counter then either decide to take your score home, or eat there on one of the communal outdoor tables. No wine or beer is served at this time but there is talk of Pane expanding into the Lux Coffee space next door which will eventually offer inside seating and hopefully wine by the glass. If all of this goes down, Lux will simply move to the adjacent building also getting a larger space. For me Bianco's food just screams for a glassed of red wine.

Ordering the Crespelle ($12) had me really excited due to the unique nature of the dish itself. Basically an Italian crepe made the garbanzo bean flour; it's filled with luscious ricotta cheese, hints of spinach then bathed in a slightly sweet tomato sauce. It was clear that after the first bite I was in love with this dish, I simply couldn't stop though glares from my dining companions made me to relinquish the plate. 

I can't sing enough praises for Biancos Housemade Mozzarella ($8), thick slabs of hand pulled cheese is paired with fresh tomatoes, a few leaves of basil, olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, that's it. The resulting texture and flavor is so toothsome and fresh that I've yet to have another as good. The salad comes with bread which I put to good use soaking up every drop of the salads milky elixir. 

Served on house made flat bread, the Soppressata with Aged Provolone ($8) which also comes topped with a healthy shave of Parmesan cheese and slices of roasted onion. The pungency from the provolone is a nice compliment to the pork-tastic slices of soppressata. 

Bianco is dedicated to local purveyors and for good reason, they make some of the best Phoenix has to offer. Take the Sausage with beluga lentils and polenta ($10) for instance. The sausage comes from our very own Schreiner's Fine Sausages over on 7th Street and let me just say, this plump link had just the right amount of meaty well seasoned punch to compliment the hearty lentils and super moist polenta cake.

If you're more of a lighter eater, I'd suggest the highly flavorful Roasted Seasonal Vegetables ($5). On my last visit the pan was filled with long thick spears of asparagus, sweet potato, cabbage, radishes, broccolini and cloves of garlic. Grab a loaf of their chewy bread ($3) and you have yourself a vegetarian option even a meat eater like me would love.

Now if they added pizza to the menu, my life would be complete.",review,-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ

Granted, they were three of the smaller peaks (Shaw Butte, Lookout Mountain, and Shadow Mountain), but little did I know it was going to be Phoenix's first 100 degree day of the year (going up the southern trail of Shaw vs. taking the dirt road up was pretty friggin' exhausting, I'll tell you that much).

In any case, after scrambling down Shadow Mountain (the third of the three), I was a sight - all sweaty, scraped up, and badly burnt due to cheap sunscreen (curse you, generic Walgreen's brand) and so I looked like a dripping wet grilled tomato, but man, was I famished. Rarely, if ever, am I in the environs of Cave Creek Road and Greenway, and when driving away trying to figure out what and where I was going to eat something, I spotted Yusef's.

Immediately I pulled in and walked inside. Now, I must have been a sight because the old couple eating at the table by the door just stared at me. I surveyed the place for a bit. Pretty much a well-stocked Middle Eastern market full of Arab and Israeli goods. I read the article cut out from the Arizona Republic some time back which gives a brief background about the owner, who took over the store in the mid-80's. 

I walked up to the counter, where the owner kind of looked taken aback by the human mess standing in front of him. I could imagine what was on this guy's mind. ""Is this guy homeless? Is he tweaking on a meth? Why's he dripping wet?"" I was hoping the iPod strapped to my arm would clue him that I was actually was exercising, to which he probably thought, ""This guy's exercising outside in this heat? Freak. What's wrong with him?""

""Hi.""

""Hi.""

""I'd like a chicken kebab sandwich.""

""That would be 20 minutes. You sure you want to wait for it?""

I was starving, but I was also dead tired and waiting while sitting in an air conditioned store/restaurant didn't seem so bad.

""Sure, I'll wait.""

""You'd like this to go or for here?""

""Here, please. And I'll take 3 Gatorades. I climbed three peaks today, that's why I'm a little messy. Sorry.""

""Uh, fine. You go sit down now.""

As I was sitting and cooling off, two guys came in speaking and joking in Arabic. They sat down, too, and looked like they knew the owner pretty well. One then tried to take the owner's picture, and the owner gave him the smackdown about lawsuits or something, even though they were very jovial with each other. But the owner was serious.

Needless to say, I didn't chance it when my sandwich came to my table, so no pics of the food. Sorry. I'd say it was tasty, though - saffron & spice marinated grilled chicken breast pieces in a nice pita with shredded lettuce, pickles, and olives. I wanted to sit and savor it slowly, but I pretty much just wolfed it down. Decent value for $4.99, I guess. 

I went over the rest of the menu, which ranged from fresh, cool Mediterranean salads to grilled lamb & beef & chicken dishes served with rice pilaf to desserts like walnut / pistachio / almond baklava to drinks such as Turkish coffee and hot anise tea. The most expensive items on the menu were three combo dishes, all $11.99. One of them is the veggie combo, which includes hummus, veggie dolmas (stuffed grape leaves), spinach pie, falafel, and mujadara (a rice/lentil dish), so definitely a place for carnivores and herbivores to break pita together.

Now, given that I only got one simple sandwich, I can only rate this place so high at the moment (I'll have to try some entrees before adding any more stars).

I'd say the store part had a pretty decent selection of goods, but there are other Middle Eastern markets in the Valley with a much more varied and greater number of stocked items. I also couldn't tell if the owner's demeanor is that way with everyone or if I freaked him out by my appearance. Who knows. Then again, if I looked like a dark red, glistening shadow, I can't imagine most places would have been friendly towards me.

Because of this, Grapevine gets an A-OK because this bar can offer a good time if you go in the right mindset.

Sephora is the adult equivalent to FAO Swartz for makeup. The second I walk inside, I feel giddy, my wallet feels too empty, I find my perfume and makeup wardrobe at home to be too dull and too dreary and I float through the store with a permanent smile on my face. 

As most ladies know, Sephora is full of perfume, bathing supplies and cosmetics galore. No matter the brand, the skin type, the quality or the budget you can find something right for you at Sephora. The staff is friendly and helpful without being too pushy. Pushy makeup artists are the worst. You can test, sample and spray to your heart's desire. They have the Sephora brand with amazing deals on lipstick, eye shadow, brushes and more. During the holidays and throughout the year, various specials line the counter tops. The rewards program allows you to justify why you spent so much because you could walk away with a brand new philosophy primer, smash-box kit or some clinique products. 

I've been shopping and browsing Sephora for years and the Fashion Square location couldn't be more perfect and fatal to my wallet all at the same time. Sometimes I walk through the store on the way to my car. Bad move Lindsey because when did I ever think I could just walk through Sephora without making an itty bitty purchase. 

Lancome, Lorac, Narz, Clinique and Dior -- just to name a few of the products available at Sephora. Any perfume imaginable is available here.

I give Props to the concept, so add a star. 
I think it's over-hyped, so delete a star. 

In the end, this place cancels itself out. (Hence the 3 stars for ""netural."") I'll explain.

The concept of an hometown ice cream parlor is applaud-able. The execution is great - everything is branded and consistent. The menu brags of wide variety, although if you don't know how to read the toppings, mixing and concoctions section, you may find yourself with a headache that's not from the sugar. So, it's best to go with somebody who's been before. I've only been twice. Each time I needed help reading the menu. Maybe that's my problem, though. See for yourself. 

So, once you select a fine sugary treat, you're ready to enjoy it. Yet, be forewarned. Don't order anything that's not in a bowl, for you'll get jipped on the portions. If you order a malt, it comes in a cool retro glass, but you'll be finished before you had a chance to unwrap your straw. Just like if you order the cheesecake, which is served on a plate. It's a tiny slice of cheesecake goodness, so don't get your hopes up. (Who really needs all that sugar anyway?)

TIP O FTHE DAY: Order whatever comes in a bowl.  (Hence the name, The Sugar Bowl.)

The portions are more than generous. I had one of the local favorites - apparently the one all baseball players and fans enjoy. It was just okay. I don't remember what it was called, but it's the vanilla ice cream served with a puff pastry. I asked for fresh strawberries on top. Yum. I was expecting the pastry to be warm, allowing the ice cream to melt and me to slip into Sugar Bliss. Instead, I needed a steak knife to slice off my bites. The pastry was frozen, like the ice cream. I was left wanting. (Not to mention I was the last one to finish, due to having to carve off each bite.)

The gourmet taco shop La Condesa is still trying to find its own equilibrium, but the line of customers nearly out the door isn't giving the new establishment much of a chance.

La Condesa is located on 16th Street, just north of McDowell, in a neighborhood that's no stranger to tasty Mexican food, including Tortas El Guero and the popular Barrio Cafe.

With no shortage of good Mexican food, how does a new place stand out? They do things their own way.

You'll notice striking artwork on the walls. The art is beautifully lit, and from a visual standpoint it's hard to look away, that's until you see the salsa bar.

Once you place your order at the counter, you're given a number. Then have a seat and a staffer will deliver a basket of crunchy chips. This is when the fun begins, tapping that salsa bar.

On each of my visits, the salsa line up was never quite the same, with at least six to choose from. Standouts include an Avocado Salsa that was vibrant and flavorful, the chunky salsa Mexicano and the Creamy Cilantro Salsa.

If you run out of chips they will refill your basket, but try not to fill up on chips while you wait for your food, because you will indeed wait, and wait, and wait... On each of my visits the kitchen took from 15 to 45 minutes to deliver my order. But don't let this discourage you because some things are worth waiting for.

The tacos are served on two 6-inch corn tortillas. You can order tacos ala carte ($2.99 each) or as a two taco plate ($6.99) with rice and beans.

The beer battered Cabo Shrimp version was hot and fresh, yet perfectly crunchy while leaving the shrimp moist and tender. The Sonoran Carne Asada had a great flavor but was more like jerky, tough and dry.

Burritos were mostly a miss, while paying a premium ($7.29). You can choose shrimp or mahi mahi. Mine were filled with too much rice and not enough seafood.

However the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Burro ($6.99) was an absolute killer. Filled with luscious roasted pork shoulder, it was so tender you don't need teeth to eat it.

The handmade Corn-Quesa is going to bring me back. They take fluffy corn masa and fold it around your selection of fillings, then use their deep frying to create a unique and substantial alternative to tacos and burritos.

Being a purist, the Traditional Quesa ($5.49) was one of my favorites, simply filled with gooey Oaxaca cheese.

The same Oaxaca cheese is paired with the earthy flavors of mushrooms in the Maria Sabina Quesa ($6.99).

For me, the thing to order is the Azteca Tinga Quesa ($7.29). Stuffed with shredded chicken, tomato, onion and chipotle sauce, the flavors were complex and each bite was sheer bliss.

I park the car and go inside.  I really liked what I saw upon entering.  Tables, booths, lots of folks eating and ordering, but nothing so out of control that it would be troublesome.  I saw thier menu and was pleased with the choices that they have.  They seem to have a really nice variety of stuff to choose from, and a lot of options for ala carte pizzas and pizzas that they sell as a menu selection.  They have meat lovers, chicken BBQ, and most common choices you would think of when pizza comes to mind.

I decided to go simple this time since it was me dining alone and my first time eating here.  I went with a small Pepperoni pizza, and dined in.  Even though they were busy, my wait in line was minimal (less then 5 minutes) and my wait for pizza was about 20.  Not bad for a late Friday night.

When the pizza came, it was like winning the lottery in my mouth, and to my eyes.  Finally, a GOOD freakin pizza in Phoenix.  FINALLY!  UGH, I've been waiting for this moment for 3 years.  I can finally eat good pizza again!  What also excited me was that they serve beer and wine here! I wanted a glass of wine SO bad, but passed because the menu said they only had Merlot, Chardonnay, and one other wine.  I would have ordered a glass if I was not dining by myself, but this was so cool.  Awesome for serving alcohol to make my day even better!

Sure, you may not encounter the rarest of paintings, but you can come face-to-face with a Monet, O'Keeffe or Warhol. You can step nose-to-nose with an Ansel Adams photograph. You can get inches away from a slurp and slap of oil onto canvas, then slowly back away until the entire image comes into view. To me, that's the beauty of it, along with your own interpretation. Some pieces draw you in while others are, to you, more boring than spilled soy sauce (sart = soy as art).

We came to see Black Dynamite, but it took us several minutes to find the theater where it was playing. There was a random movie in one, a poetry slam in another, and no one - from the concession workers to the ticket worker - could tell us where it was. We eventually found it on our fourth try.

We had a cow girl wrap large ($18) yes it was large, it was a bit burrito like with the beans, spicy mayo and avacado.I t was good, the quinoa salad on the side was nothing too special. You decide if that is a good value or not.

SET-UP: Bonnie G and Mr K walk up to the Palo Verde Lounge, a tiny run-down box nestled in the armpit of Broadway, gleaming in the diviest of glories. The outside light may as well have been flickering (but it wasn't). 

BONNIE G:  ""So, Mr K, what do you think? Isn't it all you ever dreamed about? You know it is."" 

ACTION: Mr K stands there for a second and takes in the aura. It is what he always dreamed about. 

MR: ""Hell yeah. Let's do it."" 

ACTION: Bonnie G smiles. They walk in.

SCENE: Small place. Like a shoebox. A very divey shoebox which may have seen better days. Or perhaps each of its days has always been this way. Pool table to the left. Bar to the right. Graffiti this way and that. Some palpable decrepitation. Behind the bar, a microwave. Stale scent of lingering smoke of many years still permeates. Faint scent of other odors, too. Some hipsters milling about, doing whatever it is hipsters do. Others of a more miscreant yet harmless variety. Bartender with long hair and glasses hanging out behind the counter. Mr K stands there at the door.

MR K: ""Niiiice.""

ACTION: Bonnie G and Mr K walk to the bar and sit down.

MR K: ""Corn nuts. Yo, Bonnie, they've got Corn Nuts!""

BONNIE G: ""Get it!""

MR K: ""No wait. They've got Beef Jerky.""

BONNIE G: ""Get it!""

MR K: ""No wait. Slim Jims!""

BONNIE G: ""Get it!""

MR K: ""But yo, hold on, Ramen noodles. That's dope.""

BONNIE G: ""Get it!""

MR K: ""I'm hungry now.""

BONNIE G: ""Get it!""

MR K: ""Two g & ts, thanks.""

OVERHEAD SOUNDSYSTEM: ""Wheel in the sky keeps on tuuuuuuurniiiiin...I don't know where I'll be tomorrooow....""

MR K: ""GAH. I hate this song. I really hate this song.  No, I REALLY fucking hate this song.""

BONNIE G: ""Um, I can tell. Your body's contorting.""

ACTION: Mr K decides to ignore Journey and continue conversing.

For the next long time, Mr K & BONNIE G: "".....yada yada yada, Lactose Intolerant War Stories, yada yada yada x10.....""

ACTION: Bonnie G and Mr K step away from the bar for a couple minutes as Mr K checks the rest of the place out. Upon their return to the bar:

MR K: ""Uh, where'd our drinks go? They took away our drinks. Just like that. Gone. Doh.""

BARTENDER WITH LONG HAIR AND GLASSES: ""Um, uh, sorry, dude. I thought you guys left. I can make you some new drinks, though.""

ACTION: Bonnie G and Mr K don't really debate about more drinks. It's late. Mr K lives far away. And he's, well, old. They make motion to leave, except:

MR K: ""What the hell is this?""

BONNIE G: ""It's a grip machine. It tests your gripping power. I kick all the guy's asses. Well, the weak guys who do nothing but read, anyway.""

MR K: ""Ok, let's try it out.""

BONNIE G: ""Go ahead.""

ACTION: MR K squeezes the grip gun as hard as he can. The machine indicates MR K has a grip of a 20 year old. He tries to figure out if that means he's strong or weak. He's convinced himself that it means he's strong, although he probably knows it means otherwise. Bonnie G gets up next. Bonnie G squeezes. But there's apparently an issue. Grip Machine reads that Bonnie G has the grip strength of something like a 10 year old. Bonnie G then uses both hands. No dice. The machine's not budging.

BONNIE G: ""Hey, wait! It's stuck! It's not working!""

MR K: ""Dude, Bonnie. I just did it and it worked. You're weak.""

BONNIE G: ""No, wait! You try! It's stuck!""

ACTION: MR K tries to squeeze the grip machine, but it doesn't squeeze any further. 

MR K: ""OK, it's stuck. Or maybe that's really the most you could do.""

BONNIE G: ""I'm way stronger than this. Whatever. Let's go.""

ACTION: Bonnie G and Mr K walk outside to the parking lot. Mr K takes in his experience. 

BONNIE G: ""Well, Mr K? What ya think of Sketchy Tempe?""

MR K: ""Man, what a night. This kicked ass""

BONNIE G: ""There's some more sinister and scary places I could have taken you to, but you really didn't need to go there.""

MR K: ""That's cool. I mean, this rocked. Check it...from Fresh & Easy, to Plaid, to Gold Bar, to experiencing Monkey Pants, then exploring Time Out Lounge, and then forgetting to buy Corn Nuts & cringing to bad Journey songs at Palo Verde Lounge. All within the span of 6 hours. This was a Sunday for the ages. And this here dark underbelly of Tempe? Not bad. Not bad at all. Although some parts were better than others. But now we gotta hit Sketchy Phoenix. Dive bars abound. Abound, I tell you.""

BONNIE G: ""You're on.""

MR K: ""Awesome.""

BONNIE G: ""Bye Mr K!""

MR K: ""Later Bonnie G. Thanks again.""

ACTION: MR K walks to his car. He finds himself whistling to ""Wheel In The Sky Keeps On Turnin'.""

MR K: ""GAH!""

It's true they do have a ""touch and play"" section on the first floor, but the selection is limited (I'd imagine because of the upkeep to maintain constantly played instruments that instrument neophytes are trying out).

Despite the overwhelming urge to try out the museum exhibitions, there is a great variety of instruments to look at, laid out by region, with information stands to inform you about the history of said instruments.  Pretty fascinating to see how different instruments emerge in our cultures and what sounds are deemed ""pleasant"" vs. cacophony.  One of the things that I think would make the museum experience more pleasant would be to extend the range of the ear sets they give you, because generally you can only stand in one spot before the headset reception starts to fade, which makes it inconvenient to listen to the instrument samples when there are lots of visitors at the exhibit.",review,WnmNF1mNOcbcheVpTv7ucA

While it's a good museum and the expansion has given it more space and a more sweeping, dramatic entrance, they could have worked out a few more kinks in the layout and flow of the museum.  The boundaries between galleries are not exactly clear.  You're not entirely sure which gallery you've entered.  It still feels disjointed after the expansion, and a few galleries are built like Avondale cul-de-sacs.  Perhaps I've been to too many museums on the coasts, and I'm being nitpicky here, but the layout does strike me as rather odd.

Phoenix Art Museum is still a great way to pass the day.  The collection is stronger than I expected with an emphasis on American art from the 19th and 20th centuries, and the visiting exhibitions are always impressive.  Make sure to check out the photography gallery and the contemporary art gallery with the hanging LED lights / dark room - you'll feel kinda drunk and woozy without the $60 bar tab.

I knew Jared would be home soon and hungry for dinner, and since I told him I'd make us something I ran out to the store.  Sick of the Safeway up the street, I decided to try Fry's instead.  I'd been in once before but I didn't remember it being as bad as it felt today.

First of all, I didn't feel safe (even in the broad daylight) as I got out of my car and walked into the store.  It not only felt dirty, but the people around me were not people that I felt comfortable around.  My gut must've been right, because I noticed there was at least one security guard hanging out by the door.

I held my purse and cell phone close to my body as I shopped, walking by a few people with body odor and not making eye contact with anyone.  The food selection at this location is meh, but I managed to find what I was looking for... some eggs, chicken breasts, spinach, as well as an additional $20 worth of random sh*t that I didn't anticipate buying today. (Am I the only one that does this?  I do this all of the time - I walk in with a grocery list of 5 items and walk out with 20!)  But I digress...

The thing that takes Fry's down from a 3 star review to a 2 star review is the annoying thing that you only get the special Fry's pricing if you have a Fry's card.  Usually, the check-out person has a spare card they can run for you, but today that was not the case.  Since I have at least two Fry's cards already (that of course I left at home or in another purse or something), I didn't want to take yet another one... so I had to bother the gentleman behind me to borrow his.  (Thank goodness he said yes, as it did save me $5!)  

So, needless to say, I've definitely experienced better food stores than this specific Fry's location.  (I happen to love the Fry's Super Stores by the way so it's nothing against Fry's as a company - just this specific store).  Next time I'm in need of some quick groceries, I'll be heading elsewhere.

My aunt was very happy, as she loves to shop and haggle, and haggling is the norm in Manila (as it is in Asian cities), so she was in her element here!  I, on the other hand, was bored to tears.  Instead, I went off on a stroll while aunt shopped around; I eventually found some food trucks, and wouldn't you know that ""Hey Joe"" food truck was in the area.  We just ate a huge breakfast beforehand, so that was a bust.  I did find a Maui Shave Ice food truck, but that's another review for me to write...

We eventually did check out the free glass exhibit, and it was very much worth the drive to Mesa from North Scottsdale!  I hope you enjoy the contraband photos I took and uploaded.  I hope to return soon and check out a few live shows.",review,Pt667RuH8g5tue8KcCShtQ

Finally made it this week and I took along my little brother who is a keen aficionado of all that is new, hip, cool and whatever other term kids are saying now days.  At 18 the world is his oyster and music is his thing.  That said, Stinkweeds was a big juicy slice of heaven.  Great for him, and extra ""cool big sister"" points for me.  

Entry to the place is from the back - which gives a pleasantly different impression than the front.  When we went it was a bit of a problem to get back there as the opening in the construction for ""Business access"" had been blocked a bit more than it should have been.  Word to the wise - if you miss it, just park next door and walk on over.  While you are walking, relish the fact that not too terribly long from now there will be a light rail stop across the street. My brother was quite excited by the prospect.  

Entering Stinkweeds I was immediately shocked by how small it was.  Really shocked.  But then ya look around and realize they have almost an entire wall of listening stations.  For a spot this small to invest in that is really a testament to how they value and know their customers.  In the hour or so while we were there we saw several groups of people go right to them listen to several selections and then walk up to the register with their purchases.  My brother and I meandered around the place. He went in alphabetical order, front to back.  I went right for the Paste station.  Stinkweeds in the only spot in Phoenix with a Paste station, and as I am a huge fan of Paste magazine, I was really excited.  (Review within a review: Paste is an awesome magazine about music, movies, pop culture, video games, books etc and in each edition they include a cd with new and cool music.  The Paste listening station allows you to hear more by the same artists that are covered in that month's cd.  And the cd's always rock.  Stinkweeds also sells the magazines, including those cds, in the back. They even had some old editions which really helped me when looking for some cds.)  

I couldn't find an artist I was looking for, went to the counter to ask about it and I was told how easy it was to get.  She took down my name and number and said she'd give me a call Wednesday when it came in.  Presto.  She was very nice.

I left with 2 cd's, and one on the way.  My brother left with 4 - but he wanted even more.  He was excited for some used Spoon he found.  Used Spoon.  Reminds me of an old Korn joke.  Anyhow, I highly suggest the place.  Visit regularly, visit often.

Update:  She called when the CD came in and left a message.  I never returned her call because I got busy, or always forgot, or some other lame excuse.  Almost a week later I finally made it there.  The CD was still behind the counter with my name on it. Oh yea.....",review,Re0Xw-AYkn6NK7QRk3kPEg

This small breakfast/lunch spot and bakery is just down the block from barber shop I have been going to for years, and today I happen to be in the area around lunchtime, with a craving to try something new.

I had the ham, cheese & jalapeño croque-monsieur.  What a fantastic meal.  The jalapeños were just enough to add a kick, but not overpower the flavor.  The sauce that is cooked on top of the sandwich may not be unique to french cooking, but it's not something I'm accustomed to, and I loved every bite of the top piece of bread.  The french dijon potato salad was a wonderful side dish.  If you're looking to save some fat and calories, you would go with a salad instead.  The sandwich was just the right size and filled me up.  Definitely worth the $8.25 I paid for it.  What I didn't care for was the lemonade.  Don't get me wrong; it was good, but certainly not worth the $3.00 I paid for it.

There isn't much of an ambiance to describe.  The restaurant looks like a typical cafe.  Order at the counter, they bring your food to you.  The staff is very friendly.  I didn't notice the little stand with silverware and napkins, and the woman that brought me my food saw that I didn't have a fork, so she went and got me one.  A nice little touch of service.

The big feature at Essence is supposed to be the Macarons.  I have been told that they are some of the best in the valley.  I was way too stuffed to try one, so I bought a couple of French Chocolates to take home.  I'll update the review when I have room in my stomach to give one a try.

The meat dishes were Chicken Curry, Tandoori Chicken, & Keema Matter (lamburger).  Then there was the usual spinich, potatoes, ground carrots, & a couple of other things.  Overall, the weekday lunch selection was a little sparse, the food a little salty (even for me!), the seating less than ideal (no booths), & Indian music was playing too loudly.

Sending them to a less desirable location in Phoenix?  Only in Scottsdale.  In fact, this Goodwill is actually under the name ""Redesign by Goodwill,"" and sells only furniture (new and used) and household items. 

My mom has an addiction, several in fact, including hunting for ""collectibles"" in thrift shops that she can consign for more.  The problem is if she buys 100 items for $1 each, and sells 2 of them for $5, she's made a profit in her mind.  Anywho, on her recent visit she insisted we visit a variety of thrift stores and garage sales.  This was our first stop.

Upon walking in, I noticed it smelled like potpourri.  Maybe it was because they don't sell clothing, but in any case, potpourri beats the smell of a moth ball or old people.  Before I noticed the way this Goodwill is marketed, I was  astonished at some of the furniture.  Why it looked hardly used.  Because it wasn't.  There is some used furniture, however, and you'll know it when you see it.  There was a ton of other household/kitchen items.

Ate here on the 20th after a long bout (at least a year?).  The same two chefs, Julio and Roberto, were still there, as well as Leo, the manager.  I re-informed them about my allergies and placed my order: spicy tuna ($4.50), spicy salmon ($4.50), and a soft-shelled crab roll ($7.95).  Julio prepared the first two, while Roberto prepared the crab.  I was fortunate enough to ask Roberto what he was going to substitute the * w/.  He said he could use radishes and yamagobo (pickled burdock; looks like julienned carrots).  Had I not said anything, I may have been disappointed w/ the crab roll as I was w/ the other two rolls... The tuna and salmon were pretty much just rice and the mashed fish filling.  I ate a few pcs. of each dish and gave up.  (Hey, I was hungry!!)  Had leftovers packed, then decided I'd say something to Leo, who was kind enough to comp. one of the entrees.  Fair enough, since I ate the equivalent of one.  Should I return again for happy hour, I'll probably just stick to two rolls- the dependable soft-shelled crab roll, w/c is wrapped in nori, then rice, and then w/ omelet, thin-sliced.  Yum!  

Since I didn't enjoy the other two sushi rolls, I replaced them w/ a rainbow roll ($8.95), w/c originally consists of salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and shrimp, w/ avocado and cucumber.  Mine came w/o certain items, but still was pretty tasty, and definitely more colorful, and more texturally-satiating than the mashed disasters that were the salmon and tuna sushi.

Happy hour on 8/25 consisted of a glass of the white wine cooler ($4) and the daily special of a prosciutto platter ($7 or $8), both off of the HH menu.  The ice-cold wine cooler, made fresh-to-order right in front of me, went down pretty fast.  It was quite refreshing!  The prosciutto platter was just alright-- I really enjoyed the cheese included and made a note to try some of the cheese anitpasti in the future.  I couldn't really enjoy the peppers due to my sensitivity to various peppers.  Really liked the breadsticks and wished there were more included.

The Pub Burger that I had on 12/16 was just spectacular!!

I sit and type corrected.

After coming across all these Yelp! reviews, I realized that:

A) Chino Bandido is at 19th Ave & Greenway, a short drive from my office and

B) It was just a couple blocks away from the La Quinta Inn where I was holed up for my 2 first weeks in Phoenix last year. However, I didn't know about it then, and had thus concluded that all of Phoenix was an armpit (remember, I only had the immediate surrounding environs of Greenway & the I-17 to go by those days). Back then, I was just getting food poisoning from Souper Salad and Whataburger, when I could have been eating here the whole time. Doh.

But anyway, I decided to go here for lunch today, taking two vegetarian lunch companions with me. We got there (a nondescript stripmall, which makes missing this place while driving past it for 2 straight weeks completely understandable) and noticed that hordes of techie-looking guys dressed in khakis, polo shirts, and IT company badge lanyards were also making their way inside. I then took stock of myself. Khakis? Check. Polo shirt? Check. Company badge lanyard? Check. 

Doh. I was one of them. An autobot. 

But at least an adventerous autobot!

Anyway, I opened the door into complete chaos. The line had stretched all the way to it, and I peeked into the dining area. Completely PACKED with people. It was only 11:40! Needless to say, having a long line gave me time to try and figure out their menu, written on sushi order-style long strips of paper. Eventually as I neared the register (the line moves pretty fast) I decided on the red jade chicken burrito, jerk fried rice, black beans, and veggie salad (the last one just to make me feel a little better about eating the first three). 
My colleagues got the egg foo young with plain fried rice, and chile relleno with plain fried rice as well.

Stepping into the main dining room to get my water from the soda machine, I noticed the decor that everyone was talking about: fold up community center banquet tables, cheap chairs, panda with sombrero mural on the wall...remniscent of a church bingo night, minus the panda. But again, that didn't deter every seat from being occupied. This place was hugely popular. Like local institution popular. I'm not even kidding.

My colleagues and I sat in the smaller adjoining room and wondered how we were going to get our food. Then a spirited server walked in the room carrying a tray full of stuff. ""An order for Jim! An order for Bob! An order for, uh, Sur...Surinder!"" My colleagues and I then debated about this. I'm sure the Chino folks could easily give customers a number to put on their tables a la Pei Wei/Wildflower/many other places, but the whole servers wandering around yelling people's names constantly gave an extra element of atmosphere to the place.

Eventually our food came, along with three aforementioned Snickerdoodles. I poured some of my habanero salsa all over my foil bowl and sampled everything. Beans? Decent. Jerk fried rice? Pretty tasty. Salad? Eh - standard cheap shredded lettuce with shredded cheese on top. But the burrito was interesting. It was effectively sweet & sour chicken (but tastier) rolled up in a tortilla. Maybe I'm just easily amused, but I thought it was a really cool concept. I then noticed other guys getting red jade chicken in quesadilla form, which also looked really good.  I then sat back and surveyed everything in my bowl - a combination of Mexican, Caribbean, and Americanized-Chinese food all mashed up together. Pretty cool, I'd say.

My colleagues enjoyed their food, too, which is always key when carnivores and herbivores can both be satisfied with the same dining location. And when we left the place at 12:30, I'd say the whole place was now 70% empty and completely bereft of khaki pants, which was a little weird. I guess 11:30-12:30 must be the IT golden munching hour.  

I'll definitely come back here to try some more of the combos. It's not the healthiest of eats (pointless coming here if you're on any kind of diet), but for a once in a while inventive, unpretentious lunch treat, this is definitely the place.

I was skeptical at first, mostly because I was not feeling like I wanted Mexican Seafood, but when I had the first sip of my Limonada (freshly prepared and refreshing) and dipped into the homemade chips and salsa, I knew all would be ok. 

It took me quite a while to choose from several options on the menu. Most of my lunch partners went for the baja fish tacos, another for the Camarones al mojo de ajo...or Garlic Shrimp. Two of us decided on the Camarones Rellenos (stuffed shrimp). Now when I think stuffed shrimp I think of my favorite stuffed shrimp at Papadeaux's, with lots of flavor. I was expecting the same here. When it arrived there were 6 large bacon wrapped shrimp on a small bed of french fries, accompanied by refried beans and rice. The rice and beans were very good, the filling in the bacon wrapped shrimp was very basic unseasoned Ricotta/Requeson, not like the jalapeno, garlic, with monterey jack cheese I have had at other places. It was admittedly bland. I added lime but decided against any of the bottled hot sauces on the table. I should have spooned over some of the salsa but hind sight 20/20.   The other diners with me enjoyed the fish tacos but mentioned they had had better, while the other with the Garlic Shrimp raved about that dish.

We went here on a Friday night, and prices were $21.99 for adults, not including drinks.  There's a plethora of options that will please just about anyone that comes here to dine. These options include standardized Americanized Chinese food (Like orange chicken and chow mein), various salads, a carving station (They had pork ribs, kielbasa sausage, and prime rib when we went), sashimi and sushi (nigiri and rolls), hibachi, seafood (Such as crab legs, steamed clams, raw oyster, shrimp cocktail, and various Chinese seafood concoctions), and dessert.  

The menu for the most part echoes a lot of the food you'll see at Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler or Crazy Buffet in Tempe, except for the carving station.  As for the quality of food, it's pretty good for the most part.  Out of everything I tried, I was most leery of the oyster though.  I took a tentative bite, only to discover it had a pond-like taste to it, and was very gritty.  The other seafood items were much better.  The crab legs were salty, but the meat inside was sweet and tender.  The sushi rolls seemed a little bland and were dry from age, but the sashimi was better.  They had thinly sliced pieces of white tuna, salmon, octopus, and snapper when I went.  The Chinese food was pretty good, on par with Pacific Buffet, and the prime rib was tender.

Dessert included various ice creams and gelato (Such as coconut, mango, and mint chocolate chip), mousse cakes, cheesecakes, carrot cake, German chocolate cake, custard, and cream puffs, just to name a few!  There is also a fresh and canned fruit section at the end of the salad section.  I tried some coconut gelato and various cakes.  The cakes were fresh and tasty, and the gelato had a nice refreshing coconut taste, although the texture had a weird gummy quality.

Service was very attentive.  Drinks and plates were refilled and taken away promptly.  At the end of our meal we got a coupon for the regular buffet, and for their happy hour.

Then a skinny hallway and narrow beacon of light directed me to the mecca of fabric. I was lost in no time, wandering about the rows and admiring the selections. They were categorized beautifully and the taxonomy/library science geek in me swooned. Everything was so easy to find.

Finally I made a decision and headed to the checkout. They were so nice and friendly and it was a breeze to pay and make my way home to use my newly found goods.

Anyway, I will say they get huge accolades from me with their tire center. I am a Costco member now, but I was not in 2006 when I needed 4 new tires. So my sister went with me to get the good deal and that was that. Cut to yesterday, when my rear tire disintegrated during my morning commute. The same sister brought to my attention their 5-year warranty (this is a Costco warranty, not the manufacturer's, which sounds exceedingly less headache inducing to deal with). So I call and the guy on the phone surprisingly answers in less than 15 rings, is very helpful and does not rush me like every other car service phone conversation I've ever had. (Am I the only person who does not have their car's tire size committed to memory?) Plus they're open until 8p. 

I feared they would come up with a reason not to cover the damage under warranty (I expected to have to answer some 8-page questionnaire on car maintenance and provide documentation or something), but the service guy was incredibly casual about the whole thing, and in the end pro-rated the $70 replacement tire (new) to less than $20! He said the tire was ""about a year old."" I don't where he got that from, but I didn't argue. They also waived the installation/mounting fee, just 'cause.

I really love and appreciate how accommodating for vegans they are. I love the soyrizo scramble with nutritional yeast and the garlic chili chaluhla sauce. I smother it and it tastes sooooo good that I crave it all week long. I know others enjoy the sauce too because the bottles are always being used, but for some ungodly known reason Scramble decided to stop providing the sauce. WTF man??? 

The cashiers don't seem to be especially knowledgeable about the products and it generally takes 2x as long to order a vegan meal than it does a normal meal.

They also recently started putting in bigger chunks of green bell pepper which I think really detracts from the taste. I have also been jipped on my avocado twice now, and my English Muffin barely toasted.

-------------
A few days ago I was driving down 7th St. and noticed that a new restaurant had opened out of the blue. I drove into the parking lot and peered inside. It was pretty dark, but the crowd inside seemed young and hip. I thought, ""Huh. Gotta check this place out sometime.""

Which is exactly what I did tonight. 

You walk in and you see the hip bar to your left. The dining area is also low lit and contemporary. Sade's ""Like Paradise"" is oozing from the speakers. The server, a striking and friendly woman, gave me a few recommendations. I ended up with a coconut mojito, the tortilla soup, and the Coconut Curry Arroz de Ti Coz.

The mojito was alright (there was a tad too much Malibu for my taste, but at least I tried something new), and the tortilla soup was good, but not outstanding (then again, I'm probably comparing it to more authentic tortilla soup, and I'm in a fusion restaurant). 

But the coconut curry rice? Man, that dish was incredible. All the different flavors just burst in my mouth. Definitely the right balance of coconut milk, ginger, curry, and pepper (yet not even remotely Thai tasting). Excellent dish and a really large portion. So much so that I couldn't eat it all (and I usually devour everything), so I got the rest to go. No room for dessert. So as far as the food goes, it's best to remind yourself it's fusion. If you're expecting even remotely authentic Mexican food, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Entree gets five stars, but the soup and drink both get around a 3.5. 

As for the vibe, I'd say it kind of felt like Camus, in the guise of a Latin-flavored restaurant that just happened to not be located within the Clarendon Hotel. The music ranged from the aforementioned Sade to the Gotan Project to other hip downbeat lounge tracks. Low lighting and casual hipster clientele, although not a pretentious scene at all (I loathe pretentious hipsters, along with all other phylums of pretentious people).

The server told me that they opened on August 10th so they haven't even been around for a month yet. ""But bring more people with you next time. We need to get the word out,"" she said.

Don't worry, I will. 

Ti Coz is recommended for all folks who are up for trying a hip Latin-ish place in Phoenix metro that isn't called or is anything remotely like Pink Taco. As it's brand new, you, too, can say you've started going there ""before the rest of Phoenix found out about it and thus became a crowded scenester mecca.""

While even as a student I could appreciate the beauty of a house converted into a restaurant with an amazing garden patio as its setting, it just seemed odd that a such a fancy restaurant was hidden on small street, just feet from a college campus, surrounded by parking meters and pay lots.  Now that I have eaten at House of Ticks, I understand its charm.

A while back, my girlfriend mentioned that she had a great happy hour at at this place  with friends some years ago.  She couldn't remember the name, but based on her description I instantly knew she was talking about House of Tricks.

I ordered the steakhouse BLT burger and the herbed fries.  The burger was huge compared with the other places in town.  Size does matter.  The burger was cooked perfectly and the bun and charred onions were great as well.

Chi-Fil-A used to be in malls when I was younger and they would hand out free samples of the yummy fried deliciousness on little toothpicks when you walked by.  This then would make me turn to my mother and beg, plead, cry to eat at Chik-Fil-A.  It was really good then.  This was my memory when I went to the Tatum location.  What I got was a super fried chicken fillet that needed salt-- gasp!  Who actually adds salt to fried chicken?  Well, this one tasted bland., so I HAD to.  My bun was soggy and my fries were cold.  Is this really the carbs I was craving all this time? No.  I should have gone to have sushi.

I taste tested a couple different pieces of sausages thanks to the display of samples and decided to go with the Polish Sausage to BBQ.

I finally had the chance to check out Salt River Fields at Talking Stick. I'll admit that from the freeway, it looks large and new but didn't look like it had much character. I gladly admit I was wrong! We arrived in the courtesy Zipp's shuttle that runs back and forth during game hours (free of charge!) This made entry convenient and seamless. Based on the thousands of people making the trek from the parking lot, I suggest that you get dropped off, take one of the courtesy shuttles (Zipps, Scottsdale Trolley) or find a cab. 

The game was sold out, but luckily we had tickets in hand so after getting our bags checked, we stepped inside the little Dbax/Rockies paradise. It is absolutely beautiful inside. It's clean and spacious. There are several seat options inside the stadium. They have GA lawn seats, normal seats in the stands but then they also offer ""roof"" seats which is an area on the top of the stadium that's shady and incredible spacious. They have food, seats and a ton of standing room. I even saw several ""bags"" games up there. Salty Senorita makes themselves at home with a special area as well. I think the stadium will serve as an excellent event venue during the off season. 

The stadium houses a ton of people but at no point did it feel too crowded like some stadiums do. There is plenty of room for everyone to fit in and it actually felt like they could have let in more people. However, when we left we definitely realized just how many people were there. If you did get a ride to the stadium, be sure to plan ahead and leave a couple innings early or find a ride ASAP, because once the game let's out, it's a mad house. 

On a final note, I really appreciated the complimentary SPF 30 sunscreen stations for people to use and the gourmet food they serve!

You can walk straight into the bar during games for free, without a ticket, and find yourself a seat either at the bar itself or at one of the high tables. The tables closest to the field are, of course, reserved for ticket-holders only. But the further tables, if you can nab one, still have direct views of home plate. I love coming here with friends, especially when it's a mixed crowd of males/females, under my generalization that many of my female friends aren't big enough baseball fans to sit down and stare at the field in regular seats for 3 hours. If we come to Fridays instead, the focus isn't the field but simply the atmosphere and your company. You sit in a fun environment, order drinks and food from the menu, and just have a good time with friends. The game is viewable at every angle on tv's located throughout the bar. And every time something exciting happens, the crowd at the stadium gets loud and you can switch over to looking at the field to see what's happening. When a Dback hits a homerun, the bar lights up with excitement along with the rest of the stadium. It's a lot of fun. 

Four stars and not five because I think the management can do better in terms of service. 

With all that out of the way, let me tell you the story of what happened when I had lunch here for the very first time, when there wasn't a game going on.

My friend J and I walked into the lobby area of the stadium to take the elevator up to the restaurant. As we walked toward the elevator, a Mexican man (his nationality becomes relevant later, trust me) was discretely standing by it and he got into it with us. We rode up the elevator, got out at the restaurant, and told the host we were a party of two. However, as he walked us toward our table, unbeknownst to us the Mexican gentleman was walking right behind us. When we got to our booth, J had a seat, then I slid in behind him. And it was then that I saw the Mexican gentleman slide in behind ME. 

As J and I sat there soaking this incomprehensible scenario in for about 5 seconds, the host looked at me with an equally confused look on his face and asked, ""Uh, you only want two menus, right?"" I looked at the host. I looked at the Mexican, who was sitting right next to me in the booth looking straight ahead. I looked back at the host, and said, ""Um. He's not with us."" The host looked back at me with a mix of--if you can imagine it--confusion and suspicion. I looked at the Mexican. J looked at me and the Mexican in total bewilderment. The Mexican finally turned to me and said something in Spanish. Conveniently, I speak 3 different languages. Unfortunately none of them happens to be the most prevalent second language in the state in which I've grown up. So I told him, ""No hablo espanol!""

At that point the Mexican said something to the host (who was Hispanic American) in Spanish, and he slowly got out of the booth and the two walked away. Our waitress came to us about a minute later and not having seen what just transpired, asked us, ""Is it just the two of you today?"" We burst out laughing.

That's strike 2 for you Guy Fieri (#1 is Chino Bandido, bleh).  The layout of this restaurant is very strange, but I kind of like that they separate the large groups from the smaller groups of diners.  The staff, especially our server, was extremely accommodating and put up with our certainly frustrating antics of playing board games on the dinner table.  

I was pretty hungry when we got here, so i decided to order something on the heavier side and went with the gnocchi.  The gnocchi were lightly pan fried and then drowned in a ridiculously rich cheese/cream sauce and sprinkled with chunks of pancetta and a handful of wild mushrooms.  The mushrooms tasted really weird for some reason and the sauce was too tangy.  It just didn't complement the dish the way it should have.  I did however, eat every last bit of pancetta.  Yum!  I saw a slice of German Chocolate Cake (no, it is not German in the least bit) being served to someone at another table and I gave the puppy dog eyes until we ordered it.  It came out looking rather impressive, but it went down tasting rather dull.  It was dry and lifeless and the only good part, the coconut pecan icing, was severely lacking.

Well, I won't be back here, especially after most of my companions were less than enthused with their meals instead.  Oh well, I guess that will make everyone else happy.",review,zOCdVUKUN3b-obT67Qjyww

I was on a shopping mission that the mall after work and got pretty hungry, so I hit up the food court for a quick bite. I had the Philly Chicken Pita. The food was ready quick, was very reasonably priced for the portion size, and had an excellent flavor. It's not quite as tasty and fresh as what you'd expect from a regular Pita Jungle, but it's certainly better than most fast food. However, The pita was way too soft. The wrap was falling apart in my hand even with the aluminum foil still around it. 

The set up is pretty good for a small food court spot.  You order on the left side of the counter, then move over to the right side to pick up your food when it's ready.  It's pretty much the same as the Paradise Bakery that's also in the food court, but somehow it doesn't feel as crammed.

Located in an older nondescript shopping center along Scottsdale Road, the well-kept space won't win any design awards. But we're not here for fabric choices, we're here to eat.

With just more than 100 items on the menu, there were some tough choices to be made on each of my visits with friends sharing dishes family style.

When our server brought out a plate full of crispy golden Fried Egg Rolls ($5.50), I immediately lit up. Along side was a bowl of sweet chili sauce, but my eye was more on the accompanied chili tray. Four containers each had a different chili preparation -- a smoky dried chili powder, pickled Thai chiles in fish sauce, chili paste and a fiery chili oil. If you love the heat, then stick to the pickled chiles, they nearly knocked me over.

I was intrigued when I read the description for the In-Law Eggs ($6.95), essentially a deep fried, meat stuffed hard-boiled egg. I enjoyed the crispy shell and the chewiness of the egg. After a topping of a heaping helping of chili, I found it strangely addictive.

Beef Salad ($12.95) is another one of those dishes that is served at pretty much every Thai place. Lao Thai's version was spot-on with its tender smoky meat laden with chili, lime and lemon grass. By contrast, the Chinese Broccoli and Chicken ($10.95) was so watery and bland the plate sat nearly full through the entire meal.

Another Thai mainstay is the Drunken Noodles ($9.95), which you can find pretty much anywhere. Without a drop of alcohol, the name refers to how much you'll be drinking to stop the heat. We ordered this dish mild and then applied our own heat individually. The only thing that would have made this dish better would have been an ice-cold beer.

For something unique, toward the back of the menu for there's a section labeled Barbecue. Sticking with the basics, we tried the Thai BBQ Pork ($10.95) and the Thai BBQ Chicken ($10.95). I'm a huge pork lover, but I was turned off by the gaminess on the first bite. The chicken, however, made up for this. The strips of chicken breast had a great smoky flavor and were so tender you could cut them with a fork. Served with a huge steaming bowl of jasmine rice there's little else you need, except maybe some more chile.

With my mouth still on fire, I have to agree with the owners of Lao Thai: There can never be enough Thai restaurants.",review,NBvrN_ZDpmBCsPI1qLj1Qw

*Soft Noodles (with Chicken and a fried egg)
*Mushroom Purse
*Shrimp in Lobster Sauce

I know... that's a lot of food for two people, right?!

Well, it sure was but we were hungry, and we did pretty well with it.  We polished off the spring rolls, cucumber salad, and mushroom purse and ended up taking home leftovers of the soft noodles and shrimp.  

I really enjoyed the spring rolls and cucumber salad; I probably could've made a meal on those two menu items alone!  I also liked the mushroom purse - it includes all kinds of funky mushrooms prepared in what I think was a paper ""purse"" of some sort.  I tasted ginger with the mushrooms, which is a good thing if you're like me and like ginger!  I love the concept of the soft noodles with a fried egg on top - everything is better with an egg on it!  This dish was lacking a bit of zing, but we added hot chile sauce to it and that did the trick.  The shrimp was tasty but similar to every other ""shrimp in lobster sauce"" dish I've had in the past.

The one thing I'd like to see added to SMPP's menu is eggplant; I'm a huge eggplant fan and order it pretty much where ever I go! Regardless, even without eggplant, I'm really happy to have another Chinese option close to home.  

SMPP is currently open for dinner six days a week (they are closed on Mondays).  They plan on opening for lunch in 2011.

I was looking for something different my family would try, and this place fit that bill.

Inside you will find real tablecloths on smallish tables.

We started our meal with a fried zucchini $7.95, it was a bit over breaded and just mediocre as fried zucchini goes.

For the main course we went with pasta dishes, I had the cheese tortilinni in gargonzola sauce, ($12) as I love mould cheeses. I do wish they had their ginocci in this sauce. The portion was quite small, and a-typical for a Italian place. The sauce had some gargonzola flavor but not the deep blue kick I was hoping for. 

 The bread here is mediocre and can benefit from a crisper crust, also each person gets their own oil with blasimic dipping dish, which really crows the table and made me worry about oil dipping my sleeve.

I tried some of the smoked salmon pene that had a great strong Smokey flavor and some of the fungili which was also nice and mushroomie.

I will come back again to try the pizza but for the pasta there are other options around for a good meal, but for  date this may work well.",review,f7Xe9Xzoafhi_EY4xwEpSw

I miss the days when bakeries made warm fresh soft bread composed mostly of butter and white flour. I blame Atkins and his ""fuck you, bread"" campaign... it's not like America is any less fat today for all his efforts. 

Wildflower is pretty much another one of those artisan bread bakeries... dry, stale tasting, and mostly crust. Given that, I'm not partial to their sandwiches. I thought I'd like their grilled cheese, but once I was done gnawing on my fried sea sponge oozing with oily cheddar, I realized I was wrong. If I could sum up their sandwiches in one word, that word would be ""dry"" - but I could easily think of a dozen others that would be suitable substitutes, and none of them are flattering. 

Aside from that, they have awesome salads and pasta and you can't really beat the price for what you get. I think they have good ingredients and for these reasons alone, this place would get 4 stars... they lose half a star (which is why I dropped them down to 3) because their tables are always filthy and covered with someone's dirty plates. 90% of the times I've been here, I've had to clear my own tables. 

Most people are huge fans of Wildflower and I do like it... I'd just rather eat at Pita Jungle if I'm in this area. It does make for a great alternative if Pita is packed. It's certainly cheaper and quicker.",review,ojjtPlnSmCX1zCzWL7JoNQ

It was about 6pm and the place was pretty dead.  The place has a pretty decent vibe to it but isn't nearly as eclectic as I had expected for some reason.  I don't know why, but I had visions of this place looking like some Cheech and Chong movie with tie die everywhere.

The beer selection is decent and have tons to choose from both in bottles and on draft.  There is something there for everyone and they are glad to let you sample anything on draft.

I'm a traditional pizza type of guy so I wasn't sure I was going to like Mellow Mushroom's unconventional pizza offerings.  But I have an open mind and you can't put too much weird sh*t on a pizza, right?

While their specialty pizzas are most unique and contain at least what looks to be fresh ingredients, they don't offer much in the way of taste.  I was expecting to be wowed with the great looking crust and flavorful toppings, but I just wasn't.  The crust was too doughy for me (perfectly crispy on the outside however), but the flavor just wasn't there.  They put some type of coating on it and it looks awesome but isn't flavorful at all.  I tried 4 different pizzas and they were all just ok.  They look and sound way better than they taste.  They didn't taste bad, just not awesome.  I mean you are paying ""gourmet"" pizza prices so I wanted gourmet pizza taste.

Our waitress was awesome.  She was very personable, friendly and fast.

Even if it is a chain I think this place is unique and a great addition to Mill.  However, I'm not entirely sure this place is going to last.  I don't know if college kids (or me for that matter) want to shell out over $30 for a medium pizza and a beer or two.

I mean, I usually reject any restaurant remotely chain-like, but Cheesecake Factory, you are one of a handful of respectable chains that I like and frequent.   

An easy solution when you don't know what you want to eat (you're sure to find something in the menu, yeah, it may take 40 minutes to decide, but whatever), or want to take Aunt Dorothy and Uncle Charlie from the Midwest somewhere fun, but not too edgy or Scottsdale-like.

Of course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city. 

Although Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.

Speaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was ""Squaw"" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term ""Squaw"", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as ""Negress"" or ""Jewess"". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.

And so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.

His appearances and shows have taken successful eateries from popular to super stardom in one simple episode.

Go to Over Easy anytime during peak weekend breakfast rush hours, and you'll more than likely have a hard time finding parking as well as a table. Early bird does get the worm, I had front row parking and sat immediately around 8am though on the way out there were probably about 10 people milling around waiting for a table.

Chef owner Aaron May has built a reputation on well executed high quality eats and continues to do so, including a new second Over Easy location in the west valley. Aside from the free publicity on the triple D, Over Easy is legit with many delicious, comforting and sometimes outrageous breakfast plates.

Housed in what used to be a Taco Bell, the place has been spruced up with bright yellow paint, an open kitchen and a spacious patio. Service is good and if you happen to sit on the inside, its kind of funny listening to one of the surly chefs smart off to the line cooks, not being a much of a morning person, I welcomed this.

The morning beverage line-up is what you'd expect, though it's whats unexpected which draws my excitement. The deliciously tart Strawberry Lemonade with rosemary ($3) was a welcome surprise. If anything is going to wake you up, its going to be the drinks bright flavors with a wonderful rosemary finish. The Coffee ($2.25) for me was on the weak side, perhaps that's in part to my 2 shot a day espresso habit?

Being dinner centric I decided to make one of the ""griddles"" a breakfast appetizer. Each tender syrupy fork full of the Caramelized Banana and Pecan Brioche French Toast ($7) was like biting into sweetened maple flavored clouds. The perfectly toasted crunchy pecans were a nice counterpoint to the warm chewy bananas.

Over Easy isn't all great, the breakfast sammie, Loretta ($7) came out room temperature both times I had ordered it with the Swiss cheese being barely melted. Making up for this short coming, The Wolfpack ($8) is quite the breakfast love mound. 2 eggs anyway you like them, bacon and cheese all sandwiched between layers of crisp buttery hashbrowns. The eggs were ordered over easy as to enjoy the hot gooey yolks amongst the smokey bacon, deliciously filling.

For those of you who like a contest, try ordering Big E's Pile-up ($30). Ready for this? A dozen eggs, 12 slices of cheese, 3/4 of a pound of bacon, and hashbrowns all covered in country gravy.

how do i explain this joint?

it's been around for quite some time, and since moving nearby, jsut recently began coming up in the radar of nearby dive bars.

pros: i can ride my bike here. the new owner is cool. they do poker tournaments. they do karaoke. for a dive they have nice beers on tap, like harp, guiness, ace pear and kiltlifter. they have food (never tried it, though). 

cons: standard stuff that goes along with a dive bar, but that's kind of what makes it fun to go there. my favorite old bar fly is Einstein (so nicknamed by my former roommate for his wild, white hair); he speaks in these sort of half sentences all the time - you get either the first part or the tail end of any thought that happens into his head. he favors the ladies (shocking, i know), and although seems out of it, is surprisingly lucid at 1 a.m. for example, he was going on about a sort of conspiracy theory, and to placate him and being my usual sarcastic self, i commented ""ah, i see, it's all coming together now."" at which point, whithout missing a beat, he responded, ""i don't care if it all falls apart."" and launched right back into his half-sentence tale of the collusion de jour. well played, einstien. 

anyway, back to cons: it is waaaay too bright inside here for a bar of that caliber. and, the karaoke patrons tend to be the ones trying to take their serious shot at american idol - i heard more sappy pap country love songs and creed than i can handle. i guess i'm used to more upbeat or fun karaoke, not  this, ""i'm seriously belting a love song in a dive bar at midnight on the weekend"" variety.

it's got outside seating area with tables, but the view is terrible - kyrene road right at baseline in a kind-of strip mall. 

more cons:  they only have a beer and wine license... that means no shots... or no shots made with any liquor that has over 12 percent alcohol content or something. weird, right? 

the last three times i visited Nate's Place I left either immediately after or before finishing my first beer, and the last straw was a Thursday night when I took my beer on the patio to escape the way-too-loud  creed karaoke to find a very strange group of crack heads. I blatantly studied the dynamic of the group - they were loud and seemingly begging for and def enjoying the attention - and came to the conclusion that the mid to late 20's gentlemen fancied hisself a pimp; I swear to god he even rocked a cane.

It's right in the heart of Old Town, so you can stumble here whenever your heart desires a dive, and over the years my heart has led me to Patties many a night. 

But what's a bar without games to keep you there? Not a bar if you ask me and this is one of the main reasons why Patties stole my heart. Ping pong, shuffle board, darts, pool and they also allow you to convert the ping pong tables to the home of beer pong and flip cup or whatever new game you've created for the night. Oh and did I mention that they have a dance floor? Yes, this bar doesn't let you down. 

Knowing that once you enter, you'll be sucked in for the night, don't worry about getting in a fight with your wallet. They keep the drinks priced at dive bar prices and the bar staff's on their A-game with wetting your palate quickly and consistently. 

Day drinking, night drinking or day to night drinking ... plan on skipping or slurring your way to Patties. You won't be disappointed as long as you come inside with dive bar expectations.

The fries were the biggest disappointment since I usually love those so much.  These, however, seemed to lack flavor.  They weren't overly greasy but somehow all I could taste was the oil they were cooked in.

Our server was fantastic and everyone else working there seemed competant and friendly, too.  The cook even came out to say hello and see how we liked the food (this was prior to the fries so we said we liked it fine).  They seem to have a lot of regulars so I think we stood out as newbies.

Matt's does absolutely everything right.  No freezers in the back, fresh produce from the market, and quality ingredients all the way around shows just how amazing independent restaurants can be.

The obvious bad about Matt's is the wait.  There are few breakfast places that don't have a wait on Saturday or Sunday morning and Matt's is no exception.  The problem is, however, due to the limited capacity, the wait can become excessive.  I've never waited more than 90 minutes (that was with a group of 5) but when you are hungry, 20 minutes can seem like an hour.  

If you can occupy yourself with a Kontakt or the Farmers Market long enough to stick around, the rewards are great.  Wonderful, quaint diner setting filled with bright white and orange walls and counters.  An intimate setting where you can be sure you will interact with at least someone else during your meal.  

The food is great and I have yet to be disappointed.  I usually just order the Special, whatever it may be.  It makes it easier than trying to decide.  The Five Spot is another favorite of mine - egg and cheese breakfast sandwich that is top quality.  The wife always orders the hog and chick (meat and eggs).  The best part of every breakfast is the hashedbrowns that are cooked in butter and better than you've ever had them.

The workers are sweet and full of personality.  Matt sometimes stops in to drop off milk or eggs or to say Hi to his wife.  She is usually running around making sure everything goes smoothly.

The first foul was getting there and not realizing the entire front area was a bar/bar seating and not places you can order food (speaking of which, why can't you order food at the bar... ugh). We were then thrown with a 50 minute wait for what seemed like a practically empty parking lot. As starving as we were, we probably ate way more chips than we should have and started in on a pitcher of sangria. By the way, the sangria had no fruit in it.. I think they removed it before they put it in the pitcher. VERY disappointing. 

After we were finally allowed to leave the cougar area and head to the main establishment, the food was just meh in my opinion.

Ordered one of my usuals, a large Popeye, for takeout.  Tonight's pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5mmF-H_4emxvultbneKFWQ?select=3Sdqi6icPQRcdiKTp1rf6g#9kvlhcd8-501LorXKJMh6g was, unfortunately, a terrible rendition- the worst I've had in recent weeks, and the worst I've had from Redendo's since I started dining here two years ago.  (Wow!  I hadn't realized, until now after looking through my reviews, that tonight's visit marked a date exactly two years from the day I first ate here!)  I had just clocked out of work and called Redendo's to place my order in, and the timetable given from ordering to pick up is 20 minutes, so I swung by a nearby drugstore to return some unused merchandise.  By the time I arrived, it probably was closer to thirty minutes since I got off the phone.  A young man I'd recognized as having taken down an order wrong a few weeks ago handed me the pizza box and stated that he had made the pizza himself, which struck me odd since I only knew him to man the register, answer the phone, or retrieve orders/entrees from the back.  Whoever hands me my pizzas usually shows me the finished product before I pay for it, so he opened the box and I just took note of the spinach and the ricotta and said it looked great and hoped that his creation tasted just as good as it looked.

I tore into the box as soon as I arrived home and from the first bite, I already knew that this was a subpar product.  A couple of months ago, I started to request ""light on the mozzarella and heavy on the ricotta,"" but tonight I forgot to specify this, so I was delighted to find that this pizza had a lot of ricotta on it.  However, the mozz AND the goat cheese were completely absent from this product!  There was, however, a LOT of garlic.  If you look at the photo included, you'll see there's a lot on the pizza and on the box that have fallen off of the two slices I popped into the toaster oven, and I assure you that there were PLENTY on those slices.  It was pretty obnoxious, but I persevered and ate the garlic pieces, which were much thicker than normal.  I know garlic is good for the health, and I'm still recovering from a very recent upper respiratory infection, so I decided to overlook this oversight tonight.  Unfortunately, I couldn't ignore how awful it was the next night, as the pizza tasted even worse (very bland), so much so that I couldn't even enjoy the rest of it.  It's very important to note that on both nights I ate this pizza I also suffered from headaches.  I've never suffered headaches after eating pizzas from Redendo's before, so this was also unpleasing.  I wondered if the new guy added something to the pie.  I wondered why he even made the pie himself, and not the regular cook/chef?  If no one was able to create and bake a pizza worthy of Redendo's reputation, of which I've testified to in my reviews and by word-of-mouth, why not just tell me on the phone?  I could've ordered something else.  I could've spent $25 (including tip) on other entrees and not on this disastrous Popeye interpretation...

I am very sorry not to be able to partake in the pizzas, calzones, and chicken fettuccine Aflredo entrees from here in the future anymore, since I now cannot trust the quality and presentation of the products served here, but I thank Redendo's for the great pizzas Mom, other relatives, and I did have in the past!",review,kA_88hART1Fx-zc_njLBHg

They won't let you use the exit doors near the bottom in the middle of the show so you have to walk past everyone and disrupt 3 times as many people.

I started with my standard Caesar salad but this time it wasn't very good.  It was just 'eh and had way way way too many croutons.  That salad is very inconsistent here.

Then I went away from my norm and got the pork tenderloin instead of the steak.  It was very tender and juicy but the sauce they marinate it in is not very good.  It has a weird taste to it - kinda bitter kinda sweet.  I'm going to stick to the tri-tip next time as it has always been excellent.

For my sides I had the grilled veggies and mac n' cheese.  The veggies were just ok but the mac was not very good at all.  I'm not a huge fan of the sides here.  They taste and look exactly the way they would if I made them at home = amateur cooking and not restaurant caliber.

I downgraded from 5 stars to 4 when I recalled that I do NOT like their calamari.  Mom and I are great fans of calamari and always seek it in menus wherever we go.  We love fresh calamari that have light and cruncy batter, whether it be panko, flour, or regular breadcrumbs.  Most of the time, I eat them with just a sprinkling of lemon juice.  We've given Rigatony's calamari two chances (we forgot that we had already tried it once)- the platter is heavy on the batter; very bready/doughy.

After reading a couple of reviews on Hillside Spot, I decided to check it out myself.  Besides noticing that the line was still long, despite it being around 1030-1045 on a Thursday morning, I also noticed that this place gets NOISY!  I didn't care if it was full-on sun outdoors and already hot, I could not, and would not, bear the noise indoors :(, and apparently a few customers had the same idea, bec. the only available tables out there were lacking umbrellas.  [I'd give 4 or more stars if it wasn't so loud!!]  Don't fret, though, as I found one of the staff was willing to set up a table w/ an umbrella- all you have to do is ask!

I already checked the menu online for ideas, so I already knew what I might want to try.  Bec. of the crowd and the noise that greeted me on this first visit, which jarred me and had me scrambling for some space, I wasn't able to check out the display cases and counterspace w/ their array of pastries- cupcakes, apple pie by-the-slice, cookies, tarts, muffins, and scones, which vary daily.  Do check them out!  (The apple pie is so so good!)  The daily special sounded good, but I decided I'd try the Croque Madame (a Croque monsieur topped w/ a fried egg) and the Pancakes w/ Apple Compote.  Ordering is at the counter where you pay and take a card to mark your table w/.  It takes awhile for your food to be prepared, so keep this in mind when you do decide to visit.  I'd say this would be a good time to check out the pastries, but depending on how busy HS gets, you may want to place all of your order selections in the beginning and get it over w/.

The croque madame is simply outstanding!  Well, except for the burnt bits.  The French bread (from MJ Bread, I believe) was just perfect, topped w/ a fantastic bechamel sauce, sliced ham, melty gruyere cheese, and a fried egg!  This is definitely an item I would order again and again!

The pancakes were good (loved the batter mix!), but ""apple compote,"" this wasn't!  OK, I admit, the compotes I've had thus far were fruit reductions that were thick and sweetened from the natural juices, as well as added sugar, so perhaps Hillside Spot's ""apple compote"" technically qualifies as a compote (as defined by dictionary.com- ""fruit stewed or cooked in a syrup""), but I found the topping as neither sweet nor stewed enough (the chopped apples still had a lot of crunch in them!).  Thankfully, I had my bottle of pure maple syrup in my purse to sweeten the pancakes!  :)

From the Chelsea's parking lot you can cut through the landscaping to the canal path; head west for about a quarter of a mile. There will be a paved section that breaks off the the right near some sort of sports field. Walk along the paved road which takes you right toward the tunnel that is the bats' abode and which is completely fenced off with black rod-iron fence. 

There is no place convenient to sit while you wait patiently. As the sun begins to set, if you listen REALLY carefully, you can begin to hear the bats and, in our experience anyway, one or two will venture out at a time. It seems like they boomerang out and return to signal ""go time."" 

I had expected a mass exodus of bats (even though Lisa O. specifically says ""don't expect a torrential outpouring"") after watching the famous bats of San Antonio and Carlsbad Caverns, so I was a little disappointed. Lisa O. is right: ""don't expect a torrential outpouring."" 

But, as we began to walk back to the restaurant, we could see so many bats dive-bombing the canal. Obviously, their dispersed exodus distracted me from how many I had actually seen leave the cave! 

I'd go again. Here are my tips: I suggest bringing lightweight folding chairs to get comfortable. Plan on getting there before sunset begins and staying until it's nearly dark. Maybe even bring a flashlight so you can light your return path. You can easily park your chairs on the paved section over the underpass (bat cave) while you wait for them to start doing their thing. If you hang out in the dirt area on the south side of the fencing the bats will rush past your head! It's hard to be quiet but I'd imagine it helps!

Not in the way you might think, but in an admiration and respect kind of way. Johnston owns some of my favorite southeast Valley eateries, like Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Market. He also has another place, Joe's Farm Grill, that's been featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives.

Built out of his childhood home, Joe's Farm Grill is at Agritopia, a neighborhood being built around a farm in Gilbert. Many of the vegetables and herbs come directly from the farm and right into Joe's kitchen. It doesn't get more local than this.

You'd have to squint really hard to figure out what the house may have looked like before it was converted into a restaurant. The place has a retro-modern flair with a nod to the 1960s. The lighting fixtures are groovy, baby.

The ordering process is as straightforward as the menu approach the window and place your order. You're given an electronic buzzer that gives you a good scare when your food is ready. I swear, I jump every time.

The interior is relaxed and comfortable with plenty of open seating, though the best seats are actually outdoors under giant shade trees.

Also outdoors is the condiment bar with ranch dressing on tap. Any place that has one of my favorite dips for French fries on tap is a winner in my book.

The mainstream menu of burgers, pizzas and salads caters to the stroller pushing set that frequents Joe's as well as anyone who enjoys fresh, well-prepared food.

My mouth started watering instantly when I saw how good the food looked. I quickly sank a bite into the Farm Burger ($7.99), which was well seasoned and perfectly juicy. Weighing in at 6 ounces, then covered with a choice of cheese and grilled onions, this is one tasty burger.

The Thai Chicken Salad ($8.99 small/$9.99 large) takes local greens and veggies, crispy rice noodles and peanuts, then tosses them in spicy Thai vinaigrette. This one was a disappointment because I felt that the dressing was unbalanced with too much sweet and sour and not enough spice.

Joe's pizzas take on a slightly crisp char from being grilled rather than baked. Knowing that Joe does barbecue right at another of his restaurants, ordering the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($8.99) was a no brainer. Smoked chicken breast, bacon, blue cheese, fresh tomato, red onion and with Joe's Real BBQ sauce sounded like a lot of ingredients, but they worked surprisingly well together. The tangy bleu cheese and smoky sweet BBQ sauce created a yin and yang of flavors, a great combination.

For dessert, Joe's has milk shakes ($3.99) including vanilla, chocolate and seasonal fruit.

It was a friend's birthday and she invited me out on a Saturday night. Fair enough. I braved the downtown construction and dark alleys to make my way to Burn. $5 cover. No problemo. I ordered a drink at the bar and found my friend, who led the introductions. Everyone seemed really cool at first. 

After I finished my drink, I decided it was time to dance. The dance floor was busy, but it wasn't packed. Perfect. I let go. I made my own little space among everyone else and just started to enjoy myself. My friend and her friends left the dance floor to sit at their tables. No biggie. I felt comfortable enough to keep on dancing by myself. It wasn't my first gay club, nor was it my first time essentially going out by myself. I felt fine, even in high heels and a mini skirt. Plus, the music was good. How can ya not dance when the DJ is mixing great club beats with popular hits?

You see, I'm used to people in the gay community being very friendly towards me. I'm used to people being open-minded and supportive of anyone who wants to support any local establishment that's geared toward open-mindedness and tolerance.

Even if I decided to strip down to my undies, I shouldn't be judged - especially here, where I embrace people's differences. I'm not a judgemental person by any means.

When we got there at around 7, it was busy, but we were able to get a table immediately. I think there are definitely some good and some bad things about this restaurant.  I really liked the bread and salad, and I thought it was kind of neat that the salad comes on a big share plate. I got the spinach ravioli and I thought they were fine, but needed a little more filling and a little more flavor. The sauce had a weird smokey taste, a little like sausage maybe, which made me think that they might not clean their pans well enough before cooking something new, but maybe the sauce is just like that....who knows. Anyway, it was decent, but nothing to rave about. My friend got the gnocchi (which the waitress pronounced 'guhnahchi,' which I thought was kind of funny (I'm a snob...huh?), and she said it was pretty good.

Someone came out and told us they were out of the spumoni cake and that the chocolate mousse cake usually has some kind of sauce, but they were out of that. So my friend and I asked the waitress which was better- the tiramisu or the chocolate mousse cake. She says definitely the tiramisu because they make it in-house and not so much with the chocolate, so we go with that. A minute later she comes back and says they're out of tiramisu....really? It was friday night and not very late....they should be more prepared. We decided to get the chocolate mousse cake after being assured that it was VERY good too. Well.....it wasn't. I'm pretty sure they went to Fry's next door and bought a Sara Lee cake (but like...the knock off brand of that) and put some Hershey's syrup on top. I just don't understand why a restaurant would serve something of such poor quality and not JUST serve what they make in house (tiramisu) and make more of it..... further, we barely ate the dessert, but no comment or question was given by any staff members as to whether we liked it or not.

I'm a serious t-shirt collector and have been for decades. I pay attention to that type of junk because I was involved in the d.i.y. punk scene as a kid and if you're in a band, printing your own t-shirts was par for the course... From Anvil to Hanes to newer brands like Gildan - I've tried them all. For awhile it looked like Oneita was going to be the last ""made in the USA"" company around - quality shirts there - but several years ago, they seem to have dropped out. 

Everything has been pretty much Gildan - tourist shirts and event shirts and anything cheap or free - it's Gildan. You can even pick up some blanks for a couple bucks at Walgreens if you like. The problem with them is that they are totally unreliable fit-wise. They react unpredictably to the drier - sometimes getting wider and shorter or twisting or losing hem threads. They also aren't very soft - they are very heavy, but they aren't very high-end. 

I realize it seems silly to have a high-end t-shirt, but that's what American Apparel makes. Their shirts always fit perfectly - they are all made exactly the same and they make anyone with a halfway decent body shape look pretty sexy. They are somewhat fitted without being tight. They are all soft and the cotton is combed to a rich and durable state. These shirts don't form holes as easily as other shirts I've owned - even heavier shirts I have form holes near where they rub against my belt buckle... AA do not. Their seams always hold as well.

I can easily say that American Apparel are the most reliable and best made blank t-shirt available. When buying shirts online, I only buy prints on AA shirts because I know they'll look great on me. So many online companies now use AA shirts these days as well, so it's easy.

So what about this store? What about the rest of it? Well, the store is bright and full of colorful clean blank clothes. On the women's side, there are lots of great skirts and dresses made of soft cotton. Mostly just summer accessories really as nothing here is thick enough to wear as winter cover. It is meant to be layered though as you can see by the mannequins. They have great socks and leggings and I'm told they make the best and most comfortable thongs in the business... so if you are a woman and you want to try some comfy thongs - give these a shot.

The men's side is more of a unisex area because apart from the shirts, all of the clothes they sell to men are super gay... and I'm not trying to insult anyone, it's just seriously things that are far too flamboyant for even metrosexuals. They definitely expect you to be rail skinny to buy clothes here although they carry larger sizes. They sell jeans, but they are of the skinny type. Some of the fun of going in here is to look at the gold lamet jackets and telling your friends you are going to buy it to see their reaction. 

The kids that work here are hip scenesters hired for their look rather than their work ethic. They are all thin and their level of helpfulness varies wildly between 'not' and 'somewhat'. The store is very well-lit and it's easy to find things. The models they use for the advertising and 'artwork' posted around the store look like early-stage bruised up meth addicts or early 70s porn stars. 

The biggest problem with this store really is simply that their clothing is overpriced. Sure, it's nice and well-made, but it's also expensive. Considering you can buy their blank t-shirts for 3-5 bucks each from online bulk sellers... the exact same shirts they sell in the store for 3-5 times that amount. 60 bucks for a jacket that looks like it would come in a 5 dollar hurricane survival kit doesn't spell value to me. I really think the only good reason to go here would be if you were a girl and you wanted to buy some thongs or socks or leggings or a skirt or dress. If you just want a t-shirt, there are much cheaper ways to obtain them... for both men and women.

We were immediately led to a table and given menus. The staff gave us enough time to look over our menus and think of any questions we wanted to ask in our heads first. When we finally ordered, we decided to try the quail appetizer and then each had questions on dishes. In response to my guest's questions, samples were brought out to try, which I thought was excellent.

I asked their opinion in regard to the best of the spicy flavorful dishes and it was suggested I try the lemongrass chili chicken which I did. 

Unfortunately, our food came out and our appetizer was forgotten about. However, the food was plenty and I ended up not even being able to finish it all anyway. The spice was right on par and we both seemed to enjoy our lunch there.

While CB&TL is a decent chain, some locations are better than others and this is just not one of them.  I've been a handful of times to this CB&TL for meetings as well as stopped in to get a cup of coffee or tea before or after a visit to Triple Sports (it's right next door).  It's just nothing to write home about...
Last Thursday evening, I declared this would be a meeting spot for a group of us that needed to get together to discuss an upcoming event.  It was a 5:30 meeting and I arrived a bit early to get a drink and find a table for us.  Unfortunately, there are only 3 tables that sit 4 people... the rest of the tables sit 2.  There is a loungier area that seats maybe 4 in the back as well.  Luckily, one of the 4 tops became available as I waited, but if it didn't, we would've been SOL.  
I will say that I like CB&TL sugar free vanilla flavoring as well as their lemon FruTea drink - try it if you go, it's refreshing and thirst quenching... supposedly it's made from lemon extract which is why it has that tart flavor I love so much.  Overall, I can give this CB&TL 3 stars - I think that's actually pretty fair.",review,Qr232ykh-d73aAKQqfdu8Q

Also take note that had it not taken 90 minutes to order, receive, and pay for 1 drink, I would have been home earlier.  At least the drinks were strong.

After finding the dueling pianos to not be as entertaining as we had hoped (by the way, not only is there no drink service in that area, but no table service in Palo Verde Lounge either!), we stopped at Shadows on our way out just to take a peek.  I was interested in hearing the R&B singer for a bit, so we went out to the patio.

Nice area...open air in the center, covered along the sides.  Overhead heat lamps keep things cozy.  I did find it odd that the majority of the seating on the patio is dining height tables, especially considering they don't have their own kitchen anyway.  I think cocktail tables would have been a better choice.  (Actually given the service, tables are not really necessary, but a sleeping bag is).  We also spotted only one table for 2, so clearly they assume most people have friends.

It first appeared there was no cocktail service here either, but after 15 minutes, a server made it our way.  It took another 30 minutes to get our drinks.  She did stop by the table and was apologetic for the wait.  However, she disappeared with our credit card for 40 minutes.  My husband finally went to look for her and found she was having to run the cigar counter as well!  Hire some people!!  She then couldn't find the credit card at first.  I was only impressed that my husband did not completely flip out.

If it were not for the really good entertainment, I probably would not come back.  In fact, it seems you can't get a drink anywhere at Talking Stick unless you get it yourself, and I can do that at home.  Hopefully, this was out of the norm.",review,_IwgdSjrIMwAcQdeLNhcZQ

I really enjoyed the walks I took in the park that this branch is located in.  Using the library though, is another story.  In the times I've visited, this location was either closed or full of noisy children and pre-teens who ran in and out of its doors unattended and people of all ages who talked loudly on their cellphones.  The computer section was always crowded, and I could never find a seat to use or an empty table void of backpacks and other items left there by their absentee owners.  I'd say that, for the most part, this library looked and sounded more like a coffee shop (there's a section where you can purchase coffee and some pastries) than a quiet library where one may hope to do some productive work.

There was a good-sized selection of CDs, DVDs, and books-on-DVDs, which I used a couple of times, that allowed you to place holds on-site and online, and this service was fairly prompt at notifying me of the availability for pick-up, but I quit using the services when my hands, and anything that the items touched, started to smell of body odor from the previous users that handled them!  (I think that many of the handlers carried the items under their armpits as they walked back to the library, which I'm sure we've all done before w/ books and other items, but think about it-- we do live in the middle of the desert, and bodies do get hot and sweaty...)  No matter how many times I wiped the items down w/ sanitizing cloths and washed my hands w/ soap AND sanitized them, the odor wouldn't disappear!  Utterly disgusting, and I'm not exaggerating!  Don't believe me?  Pick up a DVD or book on your next visit and take a whiff...  Don't say I didn't warn you!!

Come for the relaxing/energizing walks and views around the lakes.  There's even a playground or two on the other end of the park for children to play in, and many picnic areas w/ grills and tables to use.   You can even go fishing!  [Just don't expect to eat what you catch, though-- the lakes are contaminated w/ toxins and algae (there are signs), and I've seen more than a few floaters and dead small animals bobbing in the water.]  If you plan to walk all of the paths, make sure you have a friend or two accompanying you, esp. around sunset, bec. there's a specific location that only has one entry and exit, which could become dangerous-- if someone's stalking or following you w/ malicious intent, well, you're S.O.L.

Inside the casino is swank.  This is, by far, the nicest casino in AZ.  There are tv screens everywhere, tons of machines, and plenty of places to eat and drink.  Maybe the coolest addition from the old casino is the electronic roulette table.  Very cool.

Unfortunately, there aren't enough multi-game machines, aren't enough anything inside the smoke-free room, and the waitresses suck.  Also, for a new casino, I felt like the vent system was pretty weak.  I find the more southern Casino Arizona to smell less like smoke than this new joint.

I stopped in Crazy Jim's this morning desperately needing to fill my stomach with some much needed breakfast. I ordered up a Gyro Omelet to go. How awesome is that! And it's only $3.75.  While the presentation of the omelet itself wasn't much to look at, the eggs, feta, onion, tomato, and Gyro meat all go together perfectly. The hash browns were an okay side, but nothing special.

The prices for oysters are reasonable. The ones I had just weren't shucked properly. Every one I slurped came with an unexpected piece of shell. It was really a bummer. This place does have a helluva lot of sauces to choose from, though, if you're adventurous. 

Their Happy Hour menu isn't anything impressive. Not at all. Yucky American beer, like Bud, counts toward the $3.25 pint. Nothing else does. They do have a great Honey Ale and also offer Moose Drool here, as well as Orion, the best Japanese beer you'll find. And it costs $7.50 for the 22 oz, whereas you'll pay $9.00 for the same at Kabuki.

They also have a short sushi menu. It's not too impressive, but it's enough to pique your interest. I really loved their Rainbow Roll.

The atmosphere is ordinary - what you might expect from a place called a ""Fish House."" Nothing really stood out to me. 

Would I be back? Uhm, maybe, since they do have a couple good beers available, they serve fresh fish and they have a pretty wide selection of oysters to pick from... I just hope next time they're shucked properly. 

I would like to try their King Crab/Shrimp appetizer. It was served to the gentleman beside us. It sounded good on the menu. It looked even better in person.

This review is for my experience at lunchtime... and let me warn you, it gets busy during the weekday lunch hours, so go early or go late, but arrive at noon, and more than likely you will have to wait.  However, the community table is an option if you go solo or with a small group.

Another warning - the parking situation at noon - I think I lucked out and got the last spot in the lot; I happened to see a truck leaving when I came in, but there didn't seem to be any other open spots.  I noticed that Durant's next door offered 'humble valet parking' (interesting signage), but not sure if you are dining at Switch where you would park in this scenario.

I walked in through the back, and I liked the atmosphere and vibe immediately.  I was told there was a 20 minute wait for my party of 3, so I found myself a seat and did some work while I waited.  Pretty sure they have WiFi although I was using my Verizon card.  Great people watching was distracting me too; enough so that I missed when the rest of my party walked in!  Anyways, I caught up with them and enjoyed a great lunch...

Service was right on, and it was an overall delightful dining experience.  I had the 'Super Chop' salad - it had a little bit of everything in it (artichokes, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach & field greens) - and I added turkey for a small extra charge... it was a huge serving and the perfect healthy lunch!  (Note to self and to anyone else that may be interested in adding protein to your salad in the future - go with something other than the turkey... I hate to sound picky, but it wasn't amazing).  Anyways, my two new friends (Kate and Angie) are regulars at Switch, so they ordered the hummus and lamb apps and shared - good idea!  I tried the hummus and it was tasty - I like how they served it with pita and sides of artichokes and peppers.  It was a tad different than the hummus at Fez, or at least that is what we all decided.

We were all very satisfied and too full for dessert... I guess I'll have to come back to try that another time.  Dessert and a bunch of other menu items that sounded good.

There are also some salad options if you're not feelin' the grease. 

But the highlight for me is the green chile! And, they'll put it on anything! It's like I'm back in New Mexico!! First time I went, I had the turkey green chile melt ($7.75).

Sandwiches are served with a choice of fries, fruit, salad, cottage cheese or chips - but really?! When fries are involved is there REALLY a choice? In this case there is because they even have a couple of different types of fries (crinkle, wedge or shoestring)! 

I guess that's the dilemma: When I think of going to Pomeroy's I am as excited about the 15 beers on tap and cheap cocktails as I am about the food!

I was looking for a fun evening activity for a group of fourteen yelployees during our recent regional week conferences, and cooking class was appealing to most of our group.  Unfortunately, when I went to do some research on local cooking classes, most of them were way out of our budget.  That is, until I spoke to Marti at Sweet Basil.  

Marti was extremely accommodating and I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the pricing for our group was reasonable compared to some of the other cooking schools that I was looking into.  There was a great selection of menus to choose from as well.  I went with the ""Easy Entertaining"" option, which included recipes for the following items:
* Baked Brie with Shallots & Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce
* Smoked Salmon Cakes with Lemon Dill Aioli
* Grilled chicken Satay with Ginger Mustard Sauce
* Bloody Mary Shrimp
* Pork Pot Stickers with Garlic Soy
* Pepper-Crusted Steak with Horseradish cream
* Mini Caramel Pecan Pies with Bourbon whipped Cream

When the group arrived, there were aprons for all, and Marti introduced herself and Chef Linda prior to us beginning.  Our group was ready to get our hands dirty right away, but we did have to be patient as Chef Linda walked us through each recipe... From there, we buddied up (except for Emi H who bravely took on the Chicken Satay on her own) and were on our own with the large kitchen and ingredients.  Tiffany and I did the Brie which was by far the easiest, but we had fun with it and it turned out incredibly (if I can say so myself)!

All in all, this was a fabulous evening, and great for team building too... but if you do book Sweet Basil, a couple of things to keep in mind that may be helpful:
*While SB does provide iced tea and water, they allow BYOB, so if your group is anything like mine, I do recommend taking advantage and bringing some wine!
*You'll likely begin your class promptly at 6:30, but won't be digging into the food for quite some time, so you may want to grab a bite prior to arriving or ask about purchasing some snacks to nosh on while you eat.

In addition to the above, note that SB is also a fabulous store for all kinds of cookware, kitchen accessories, and more... I purchased a great little salad dressing bottle while I was there and definitely could've done a lot more damage given more time!",review,RvvYZthPciQNsZ6xkpYEPA

Still not sure about that. However, it did also indicate that somewhere on the other side of the road, additional parking existed also.

I didn't have coffee, but I did have a chicken salad with mandarin oranges and pecans that was delish and almost too much for me to eat at one time and on the recommendation of the staff a coconut and lime Italian soda, which was a brilliant and refreshing flavor. Also, thank you. I now have the lime in the coconut song in my head.

Wifi was a definite must and well appreciated and I loved the artwork and decor. The table we sat at was the perfect size for both of us to be on our laptops and eat and work.

ATMOSPHERE: Fairly minimalist in setting. A bright open rectangular space with a lot of natural light; white walls adorned with modern art. All tables are two-tops and there are no couches. An outdoor patio overlooking 7th street that also has a few tables. Mellow downtempo music playing....

WI-FI?
--------
Yes. Outlets, also yes.

FOOD?
----------
No cooked food prepared in store. Just pastries and quiche. Always the quiche, it appears. Pastries included bear claws, sugar cookies, and some humongazoid apple crumble death star thing...

DRINKS
------------
An array of your regular coffee beverages, along with a good selection of iced teas and blended coffee drinks/smoothies. 

SERVICE
-------------

Jared and I felt like trying something new one night last week, and after reading about how great Black Chile's burger was from our friends at EaterAZ, we thought we'd give this place a shot.

The restaurant itself is spacious, the hostess and service attentive and friendly, and the decor is tasteful.  But unfortunately the food was nothing special, and I won't be rushing back...

We started with chips and salsa.  I think they bring these to everyone.  These weren't bad.  For our meals, Jared went with the burger and I went for the fish tacos (per our waitress's recommendation) and a side of corn.  I liked the sticky rice and beans it came with but the rest of the meal was underwhelming.  Jared didn't love his either.

Since my visit, I learned that this concept comes from restaurateurs Michael McDermott and Jason Merritt, who have been involved with the development of numerous restaurants including the famed Kona Grill. I thought it felt a little chainy!  That explains it ;)

I'm pregnant so I didn't have a Corona or margarita, which may have made my meal taste better, but regardless, I've experienced much better Mexican food before... and with so many other Mexican concepts to choose from in the Valley, I probably won't be rushing back.

* Friendly, professional and candid servers.

* Your tableside made guacamole which is hands down the most innovative and tasty guac I've had in a while.  And I consider myself a guacamole junkie.

Bacon cheddar biscuits-Bacon and cheddar in a warm biscuit, golden brown on the outside, soft on the inside.  Yes, it was terrible.  One could only imagine the horror I endured.

The Science Center is equivalent to some of finest science centers across the nation with their state of the art technology, interactive exhibits and activities for all ages. 

During past visits, I've enjoyed traveling exhibits like the Titanic exhibit years ago. As you entered, they gave you a piece of paper with a name on it. As you walked through the exhibit you looked for the name and learned about who the person was. Then at the very end, there was a wall full of names and you got to see if the name they gave you survived or not. Even though I was a history major in college, I learned several new facts in this exhibit and it was extremely interactive and educational with fun mixed in! 

Currently, they have an exhibit called ""Forces of Nature"" where you can learn about different weather patterns, climates and how weather happens. In the middle of the exhibit you can walk up onto a stage-like area where you experience different weather patterns interactively. I won't give it away, but you could get stuck in some rainy weather!

The amount of thought and energy they put into each exhibit is incredible and it's an extremely dynamic experience. Throughout the exhibit, I ""x-rayed"" a body and learned about different body parts, I entered a stomach and discovered the ins and outs of the digestive system (no pun intended) and there was even an intestine slide to take a ride down. I placed my hands hands on a censored area and a drum beat to the rate of my heart! Needless to say, the exhibit excited me and while I definitely am still a kid at heart, it was the adult in me who couldn't wait to come back and explore some more. 

Before I go, I want to share some other favorites that the Science Center offers...the Imax and Adults Night Out! They have a state of the art, full size Imax theater on site and they show movies like Under the Sea. I am a big fan of the Imax and have been swept away into different worlds many times here. Adults Night Out is just that, where you can explore the exhibits, attend an Imax show and have a fun night out sans any children! I also heard a rumor that they might be bringing alcohol back during these nights! Let's wait and see. :)",review,MwmXm48K2g2oTRe7XmssFw

There was a wait when we got there, the lady told us there was a fifteen minute wait, but it was really like a 40 minute wait. It was nice out though, so that's ok. We got sat and both ordered the betty boop and the BF ordered some grits too. The betty boop is a fried chicken breast and a waffle. The food came out quickly and was good. The waffle was sweet and substantial and the chicken was relatively tasty (could have been spicier) and the breading was good. Overall the food was good. So why only 3 stars? I thought it was really overpriced for what we got. Our bill came out to be a little over 20 dollars. I just feel like for the product used, it should not cost as much as it does.

My mom was in town and as my birthday drew near she asked where I would like to go to dinner. I had 2 area restaurants I had not tried on my list and Centurion was one of them. 
We bundled up and walked over. The cold weather was not conducive to patio dining, even with heaters, so we choose to eat in. They had a 9 top in the corner and an incoming reservation of 4 so we sat at the counter. I usually enjoy this anyway because I love watching the chef(s) do their thing. Of course in here it is so small it doesn't matter where you sit, you have a front row seat to the action. The chef was working sans sous chef and was hustling as were his waitress and dish washer. 
As we were getting settled in and reviewing the menu, which changes seasonally (as do the wines), the 9-top was receiving their appetizers, stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto served with a taragon cheddar sauce.  Mmmm.....we had been looking at the Mushroom, goat cheese and spinach strudle, but this helped us decide.  
As soon as I saw lamb on the menu my decision was made for me.  My mom was torn between a few dishes but decided on the taglioilini with pulled duck.  The dishes were great!  The pesto risotto that filled the mushrooms was cooked to perfection with excellent texture.  The wood oven imparted a wonderful richness to the already rich dishes we ordered.  
I would have to agree with Dante's review about the pasta dish, a thicker noodle would have really made the dish stellar as the thin pasta was overwhelmed by the sauce.  It was also quite ""oily"" and was evident when we attempted to reheat the leftovers (removed several tablespoons after reheating).  Not a ""diet"" dish that's for sure.  

My lamb was tender and not over done, although I prefer it more on the medium rare side. The dijon herb crust and the chorizo in the risotto played off each other well.  The savory crispy yet fluffy herb and cheese waffles which accompanied the lamb were also a pleasant surprise.  Taking a piece of waffle and a bite of the risotto with the lamb was a wonderful rich taste treat. 
The chef made great wine recommendations to accompany our dishes. 
We were too full for desert...next time I guess....

So why 4 stars and not 5?  The ventalation was poor.  We left smelling of all the food being cooked there that night and even had to go home and change our clothes and freshen up  before we went out again.   Otherwise it was a wonderful evening and a great meal.",review,e34tIpveepWkpvOuv_boqw

Great produce, great natural health section, good deli, and best of all, cheap-ass prices (ie. deli sandwiches for $2.99 - now that's what I'm talkin' about!). 

Even though most of the Sprouts produce isn't certified organic, is spending $5 on gas and another $5 on two tomatoes at Whole Foods really worth it? 

I gave a minus star because their produce section is lacking at times. Any time I have to go to another store to complete my grocery shopping, I get pissed. For months they didn't have serrano chili peppers. Now I thought it was a given that they'd be in every grocery store, especially here in the southwest, but maybe Sprouts shoppers as a whole don't cook spicy food, who knows. But they have it now, which means all is ok.

There also used to be a middle-aged man who'd sometimes shop at this particular Sprouts at night wearing a babydoll dress and adult diapers with his hair in pigtails and a pacifier in his mouth. The first time I saw him I thought, ""There's no way this dude's for real."" Fellow shoppers would just stop and stare with their mouths agape, but the staff had obviously seen him many times before since they'd give him no more than a familiar glance. And then I saw him a few times afterwards, and so he was the real deal.

While their grand opening isn't truly until Tuesday (12th of May) they seem to be ironing out their kinks pretty quickly with only a few minor hiccups mostly due to computer errors rather than human. 

The menu is made up mostly of burgers, salads, lahvosh pizzas and a few entrees. We ordered a few starters, the LB Favorite (bacon and roasted corn lahvosh pizza, half $9) as well as the Queen Creek Olive Oil (kalamata, tomato, fresh basil and feta lahvosh, half $9). You know you can put bacon on just about anything and have it taste awesome but paired with the right flavors the good becomes great! The sweetness of the roasted corn with the savory saltiness of the bacon sent me into piggy heaven! Was so good I didn't want to share but alas, I'm a good guy like that. The Queen Creek Olive Oil lahvosh was very tasty, the lahvosh being crispy and light but sturdy enough to hold the ample toppings. I love olives and olive oil paired with cheese and the feta was a great idea. The cheese being strong enough to stand up to the kalamata, the tastes were right on.

Meanwhile we were all sipping on Nimbus Brown Ale ($4) which was ice cold, rich and complex. Nimbus is certainly one of my favorite craft beers and at 4 bucks, nice! LB also has a full bar and while cocktails around 8 bucks they pours are generous.

I ordered the Fire Island ($10) which is one of several classic Pischke dishes on the menu that made it over from the old days. Oh yes, the owner Sid Campbell was a cook at Pischke's Paradise for over 12 years before it was ruined by new owners. The Fire Island is a pizza with chicken breast, red onion, green chilies and a cream cheese sauce that is absolutely finger licking tasty! Be sure to ask them to add 2 over easy eggs on the top, outrageous! 

The Mr ordered the Roasted Green Chile Cheeseburger ($10) which is served on MJ's Breads giant English muffin. The beefy flavor combined with the soft texture of the English muffin was excellent, you can taste the quality and the smokiness of the green chile. An order of house fries comes with the burgers and sandwiches and let me just say, they were seasoned so well that you could have chowed them down plain. However, the bread and butter pickle ketchup is simply amazing with its dice of bread and butter pickles, never knew ketchup could be elevated to another experience!

* Spring Rolls - Excellent and I loved the sauce.

* Hot & Sour Soup - Excellent because I always custom order it with all the meats and shrimp.  It costs a bit more but it doesn't matter because it is so good.  The only problem is that I ordered it too spicy.  I went with the Thai Hot and it was a bit too hot.  I'm going with medium next time.

*Cashew Nut Sauteed Plate w/ Chicken - excellent and full of good stuff.

The first thing we noticed walking in is how surprisingly nice and clean the place is for a middle eastern restaurant. Seriously, it's really tidy. The second thing I noticed is how odd the waitress was acting. She had to be on something crazy. She was practically running to do things and there were only 3 tables in the place, all busy eating... just bazaar. She was not very friendly but a competent waitress nonetheless. She said things like ""you ready yet?"" and ""give me your cup so I can get you more soda."" Whatever, at least she was doing her job well. 

I had the shish kafta which is basically a shisk kebob in a sandwich form. It was very good with a nice mix of veggies and good hummus. The only complaint from me is the lettuce they used was of mediocre quality, and I like the way they built it, with the veggies on the inside. Nothing is worse than when your veggies all fall off because they don't have anything to hold them in. What a novel idea, put the meat on top and use that to hold everything in there. I can't believe I've never thought of that myself when I make pita sandwiches. Leave it to the Mexicans, those buggers can figure out how to make a rocket ship out of duct tape and cat hair I swear.

Side story, I had to replace a window screen on my 3rd floor and I called like 10 screen companies and none of them would do it. Finally I got the nerve to buy a screen at Home Depot and pay a Mexican to put it on. He and a friend climbed the damned tree out front and put it on a stick. While holding it in place with one stick, they used another one to turn the fasteners and lock it into its fittings. Fucking a.... 10 professionals couldn't do it, but the first Mexican day laborer I get figures it out in 5 minutes.

Whichever topping you pick it also has the other half of the bowl covered in veggies.  A combination of zuchinni, celery and broccoli.  Under the protein and veggies is your choice of rice- white, brown or rice and red beans or for 79c extra you could have noodles.

The food description Matt C. described is accurate so I'll elaborate on other points. The menu, which we both took pictures of once we saw Goat Curry listed, is small and interesting. It leaves me wanting to come back, and yes, next time, I will be getting the goat curry. I'm sure you are all lining up to come with for my 2nd visit now. 

I had the jerk chicken with rice, plantains, and a side of vegetable (I had two to choose from - steamed eggplant or bok choy). It was very delicious. The rice was slightly dry and not very flavorful, and wasn't my favorite, but it was a nice addition to the jerk chicken, which had some decent spice to it, actually probably a little more than the curry from what I remember. 

The plantains, oh the sweet plantains were PHE NOM IN AL!!!!!! Well worth it.  In addition we had a side of roti for the curry order and it was some delicious bread. Probably the best bread I've had aside form nan. Why do other countries make bread so much better than us? Is it because we all try to swear ourselves off of carbs?

To drink, I had pink ting. I know, not surprising. It was a carbonated pink grapefruit beverage using Jamaican pink grapefruit, bottled in Jamaica, but a product of Canada. That made me giggle, but it was delicious. And, well, the name itself makes it worthy.

Today was a typical experience.  Most of the trays were wet or dirty or both.  I had to go through several glasses to find acceptably clean ones...acceptably clean, not necessarily clean.  The line was backed up so we thought paying cash would be good.  Too bad the guy working did not have change to break a $20 when our bill was $18.30.  Most every table was dirty.  There was no ligonberry drink (the one highlight of this experience in general) to be found.  A small child was spotted running around like a lunatic, only stopping long enough to eat food off of a dirty plate she found in the clean up pile.  Parents?  Anywhere?  Hello?  Unfortunately, I was not in the men's room to witness the horror of a man chasing a naked child through the restroom...naked as in completely naked.  Luckily it was the child and not the man.  And luckily it was not my husband doing the chasing.  At least I don't think it was.

So if this is everyone's idea of a 5-star experience, I'm sorry for you or maybe for me for not seeing what everyone else does.  In any case, I've had better, but I'm sure I will be back.",review,oBVS96DtPGk9GU8zPx5Hjg

(Turned out that the ""gift w/ purchase"" promotion will not be offered till September.)  Macy's turned out to be my first and my last stop that day due to time constraints, the way I was treated, and the fact that the Macy's rep behind the Dior counter quoted me a lower price for the lipsticks I wanted to purchase- I was going to buy at least two ( Stiletto and Envy), and I also started looking into the $30 Rouge Dior colors and the $34 Serum Rouge selections.  Since I am not fond of returning tainted lipsticks, I proceeded to sample some of the testers using the disposable brushes they have for customers to use.  It wasn't long before a woman permanently parked herself behind and to the right of me where I could see her. Even though I greeted her a nice hello and continued to sample colors, after awhile, I felt so uncomfortable, that I decided I'd just stick to the two choices I initially made, since I can always come back if I ended up liking the products.  

The original rep rang my purchases up, and the total was higher than I estimated it to be.  I asked her why, and she said that she'd looked at another product's tag when I had asked her earlier for the price.  Since it was only a few dollars, I decided I'd let it go, and left Macy's.  

I returned to Sephora a few days later to restock on Clinique colors that I love.  I always buy three or more of these at a time to eventually replace the almost-new ones I have already, since the bases fall prey to Arizona's heat and break off.  (I don't have the patience, nor the time, to save these broken pieces in pots and apply them on w/ lipstick brushes.  I wish I did, for I would then have the extra cash to spend on my other hobbies of dining out and watching movies at Camelview!)  Anyhoo, I ended up buying five colors, which amounted to around $77, including tax (three for me, and two to gift Mom w/, because I like her).

See Macy's?  If you didn't make me feel like I was a marked crook by sending your guard, who was ready to jump me at the slightest move, I'd have spent so much more money splurging on my favorite makeup items at your counters, rather than at other stores.  I'm not even pondering on how the rep mislead me by quoting the wrong price-- OK I will... How could she do that when I specifically gave her the product's line and color to look up?  Nevermind.  I'm making it a point to boycott this particular location.  Should I ever want to buy anything from a Macy's, I'll either go to the one in Chandler, or to another state even!  Perhaps I'll just spend my money at Dillard's and Sephora.",review,HZf4PgSXgGZ0EPGa-cuUPQ

We had a few encounters with westside trash on the way driving their lifted trucks trying to cut in line and use the size of the vehicle to intimidate me into letting them have their way. It didn't work. White trash, stop breeding, please. The stupid baseball sculpture outside invokes the emotion ""WTF IS THAT?!"" I truly hated it.

Everyone we encountered at the park was very nice, especially in contrast to Surprise which employed some of the rudest and most gruff old men I'd ever come across.

I don't know how they stay open!

That said they have been in business since 1983!!  That is amazing to me.  I have lived here for 12 years and never even noticed or heard of the restaurant on Southern, near Dobson Rd.

I find the prices to be a great deal.  The kids meal is $4.50 and comes on a cute brightly colored fish plate.  It contained teriyaki chicken with rice, a chicken skewer, a gyoza (pot sticker), fresh grapes and edamame.  A drink was also included in the price.  The first drink he brought out for my three kids was a bottle of sunny delight.  The kids were thrilled but opened it and it tasted funny.  I checked the date and it was expired.  The owner was apologetic and brought out peach and pineapple drinks in a can.  The kids were happy with that as well.  They all ate amazingly well... very happy with the kids meal.

I got the tofu teriyaki the first time and the tofu sukiyaki the second time.  Both were good.  Served on a tray with rice, miso soup, edamame and a salad with ginger dressing and 2 pieces of agadashi tofu.  The price is $9.

On the hunt for some great Italian food, it's no surprise that Guy Fieri, of the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, found La Piazza Al Forno, one of downtown Glendale's independent eateries.

If you've never been to downtown Glendale, it has a certain untouched-by-progress charm that's worth seeking out. There are antique and gift shops, historic homes and a choice of interesting places to eat.

Owned by chef Justin Piazza, La Piazza is all about comfort Italian. The menu might be small but it packs a wallop, offering a range of pizzas, pasta and a handful of salads. I went hog wild because there were so many things that I wanted to try, and at their low prices I indulged.

Might as well start with something light, like the Spinach Salad ($8), which is covered in a warm bacon vinaigrette and topped with feta cheese. The spinach was super fresh, showing the commitment to the best and newly picked ingredients. Considering the meager cost of this huge salad shared by two hefty eaters there is some serious value to be had here.

Antipasti offerings are kept simple, with only a handful of choices, but one caught my eye. I was elated with each bite of Fried Ravioli ($8.50). Breaking through the crispy pasta revealed an inside filled with a molten cheesy heaven. This come with a side of tomato sauce for dipping and once you get started with these bad boys, it's hard to stop.

Based on the name alone, anything called Spaghetti Pie ($9) is worth ordering. So I was tickled when the massive slab of baked spaghetti resembling a brick was set onto the table. Spaghetti was layered with cheese and finished with a tomato sauce cream sauce that was so satisfying. The spaghetti pie was a daily special, but from other visits it's pretty normal to see it featured.

Their pizzas are baked in a wood-burning oven. Preparation takes only a few minutes and the intense heat slightly chars and crisps the pizzas. The Italian Stallion ($16), in all of its meaty goodness, is covered with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto and sopressata. For some, all of this meat might sound excessive, but the distribution and amount create a balance of cheese, meat and crust, making each chewy bite a pleasure.

Guy Fieri has taste you can trust, proving himself once again with La Piazza al Forno. During peak dinner hours there will be a line out the door. If you want to avoid this, go for lunch the odds are you'll be seated right away.",review,jgbEZzERVI4yvAAtXWW93A

It wasn't the worst, but honestly, I wasn't all that thrilled.  I was hoping for more.  When I walked in, the place was empty!  There was one guy sitting and eating in the corner.  I will say that its because today is Christmas Eve, and everyone's out doing other stuff getting ready for the holiday.

So, I walk in and go to the register to order.  I had a few questions since I'd never eaten here before, but the girl behind the register was inputting stuff in and asked me to hold on for a moment.  I waited a few minutes for her to finish, but it felt like forever.  I was hungry and just wanted to eat.  Anyways, she takes my order, and I went with one of their combos.  I got a Brisket sandwich, mac and cheese, along with a pop to drink.  

The food was done quickly, but I left feeling kind of let down.  The mac and cheese was soupy, and had quite a bit of pepper in it.  I ate about half and threw the rest away. Normally I would take something like that home and snack on it later, but I didn't care for it, so I chucked what I I didn't eat.  The Brisket itself was okay, but the BBQ sauce had no kick to it.  I don't mean that it was mild...but it had no taste.  Plus, they didn't put a lot of sauce on, so that half my sandwich didn't have BBQ sauce on it.  :-(

Normally, when I eat at a BBQ place, they have additional bbq sauces either in squirt bottles on the table, or in a vat somewhere in a central location for you to add on if you would like more.  There is also usually some kind of variety to choose from.  Tangy sauce, maybe a hotter bbq sauce, etc.  All I saw was a vat near the napkin area, but it wasn't labeled and I didn't trust putting in on my food.  I didn't know what it was.  I assume it was extra sauce, but I don't know that for sure since there wasn't a sign.  

Also, the place was FREEZING.  Look, I'm from Michigan and have a pretty thick skin for cold.  But, the last few days, its been quite cold outside, even for Arizona standards.  30 something degrees and night, with a high in the upper 50's to 60's during the day.  Most places have the heat on.  Well, not at Honey Bears.  No heat. I could feel that the cold had seeped in, and I wasn't wearing a coat, and wished I had.  fail.

So, when my friend suggested we head to this place for dinner, I was all about it.  I read the reviews that came before mine, and tried to be optimistic too... 

And while it appears that GG has addressed the complaints about not being vegetarian or food allergy friendly, they can't do much about the chain feeling one gets upon dining here.  They can, however, work on their service, which was unattentive and unorganized during my visit.

My friends and I went up to prepare our bowls at the buffet.  I prepared mine with shrimp, calamari, imitation crab meat, vegetables, egg, and a mix of honey soy and spicy sauce.  I handed it over to be cooked up and put on brown rice, and it actually turned out pretty decent.  I ended up deciding I wanted to go up for seconds.  This was after our waiter just threw our check down at our table without asking if we wanted anything else.  My friends went for dessert and I went for another bowl after that.  I guess our waiter took the check back when we flagged him down to let him know this.  I was busy finding the hostess to request a new bowl for my second helping.  

I had to ask several times after that for some more water, and when I was waiting for my cooked food to be delivered, the food runner attempted to deliver the wrong bowl to my table, even admitting that sometimes they get the numbers mixed up... not a good sign.  

If you like dining at places like Sweet Tomatoes, (not that there is anything wrong with that... I even hit up Sweet Tomatoes every now and then), this place could be up your alley.  At dinner, it's $9.99 for one trip to the buffet and $13.99 for a bottomless bowl.  If you drink and/or have dessert though, it can get pricey for what it is, but again, the concept is solid... there is something for everyone to choose from whether you like meat, chicken, fish, noodles, rice, etc...  I would suggest GG do a better job with training their servers and keeping the buffet bar stocked and clean.  I'd also suggest they do something with recipes for sauces as we all just guessed on how much sauce to use and made our own combinations of ingredients.

We had some wine and food out on the back patio. Unfortunately we arrived too late for Happy Hour.  The $5 a glass is a great deal even though the choices are limited. The even better deal is the free bruschetta board if you order a bottle; we definitely would have taken advantage of that if we had been there an hour earlier.  We were lucky enough to get to listen to the wonderful music of Sarah Vanell who was performing there that evening.  I thought I recognized her voice from Vincitorio's and so I googled it when I got home and sure enough it's the same girl.  She sort of sounds like Jewel but she sings a wide range of songs and puts her own stamp on the covers.  Just an awesome performer.

The bruschetta choices on the menu are pretty much the exact same descriptions as the offerings at Postino but after sampling them I can say that they are not quite the same caliber. The warm brie was good but not as impressive as I thought it would be.  I agree with April Q. that they are pretty skimpy with the bread which is surprising since it is just plain pita and didn't even taste like it was baked there. We also got a veggie flatbread which was a favorite of the girls who had been there before.  That was pretty tasty and I highly recommend it.  The dinner menu was short but there were a few entrees on there that I would like to try in the future.

The other girls shared a couple of bottles of Pinot Grigio that were very reasonable priced.  I, the lone red drinker, had a couple glasses of a really nice GSM blend that I can't remember the name of (their wine list on the website must not be up to date since I don't see it there either).  Our server was absent for a while in the beginning but made it up by being very friendly and attentive the rest of the time we were there.  The main attraction of this place is their patio.

Between you and me day drinking isn't one of my strong suits and has to be justified for me to do it.

A great happy hour not only starts early but allows you enjoy well priced libations and food at great prices. That's when great happy hour specials come into play, such as at the recently discovered 5th and Wine in Old Town Scottsdale. Opened by the same owners as the fantastic Humble Pie and the new Living Room Wine Bar in Chandler, they create a space that's welcoming, relaxed and comfortable. Service is polished with an attractive and eager staff that seem genuine and friendly.

Day drinkers can delight from 3pm-7pm daily, including weekends, with 5th & Wines great happy hour with glasses of wine priced at $5. The deals don't stop there, also offering a short list of fantastic draft beers and well drinks both at only $4.

5th and Wine also offers several well priced appetizers to pair up with one of their amazing wines. Salty cured meats always taste so good while sipping drinks, and the Prosciutto Wrapped Breadsticks ($4) filled the ordered perfectly. They take long thin bread sticks then wrap them with thin slices of cured pork and finish them horseradish cream, incredibly addictive.

Served with crunchy jicama and ranch dressing for dipping, the Spicy Chicken Drumettes ($4) might be the best deal on the menu. In total there were 12 plump and meaty drumettes that were cooked until tender then slathered in a spicy vinegary wing sauce, basic I know but executed perfectly.

The center piece to all of the eating and drinking were definitely the Bruschetta ($9.95 for 6). Starting with a thick slab of toasted artisan bread, you choose from 8 different preparations ranging from mild to sublime. Standouts included a tasty peppercorn crusted steak with dollops of nose clearing creamy horseradish and for the wine centric, apples with brie and fig jam which was then drizzled with honey and agave syrup. After trying so many, my absolute favorite had prosciutto, mascarpone cheese, figs and tomato jam. Salty, sweet, creamy and chewy, this touched on everything I love about well prepared Bruschetta.

At these prices you can easily put together a hearty meal but why stop there? 5th and Wine also offers a great selection of salads, sandwiches entrees and daily specials on their regular menu.

Not to be missed, the 5th and Wine Burger ($11.95) starts with all natural ground beef then is topped with Cambozola or White Cheddar, caramelized onions and organic arugula. I opted for the addition of an organic fried egg for only $1.50 more which added the creaminess of hot egg yolk to each beefy bite. Almost as good as the burger, the 5th Ave Sausage ($10.95) uses Schreiner's sausage, caramelized onions, roasted peppers, arugula and whole grain mustard on toasted focaccia. However on my last visit, like the burger, the sausage was served on tender flaky brioche, a perfect substitute.

I'm told what makes Famous Dave's so famous is their BBQ sauce. Honestly, I wasn't impressed with any of their sauces, although it was fun for our waiter to explain each one, then draw the first letter of the sauce's name on a plate - easy for us to sample! 

I flipped through their beer menu and was really happy to see they have Alaskan Amber Ale on tap, as well as Sam Adams. In the bottle, they have other varieties, like Red Stripe. I have to admit, for being a franchise, this place offers up a beer selection that's hard to beat (for your Average Joe destination).  The Alaskan Amber was the highlight of my day, for it was served ice cold in a chilled glass. Perfection! It went really well with the salmon I ordered, along with one of the best cornbread muffins I've had! 

While I didn't finish my entree - I found the green beans to be too cold and bland and the salmon to be just ""meh"" - I did find delight in 3 things. 

1. Alaskan Amber Ale on tap
2. Cornbread Muffin
2. Warm apple chutney on the side

Would I go back here? Yes, I definitely would, even if it's in Mesa RiverHell Marketplace.

Famous Dave's is a sure compromise for my family. I can drink the beer. They can eat the BBQ. My dad even said he'd give this place a 5-star rating. 

So, in summary: This place is a family-pleaser, and I can't refuse any invitation to partake of the 3 aforementioned treats!",review,dUi5Lg1Ay3HwK0p_ZaXNYg

It's in a really bad spot for the type of bar it is. Sleepy Dog is a coffee shop version of a Microbrewery. It only deals in its beers. It has short hours, and it's only the type of place that you you'd stop in before you start your night, but it doesn't serve food (they do have complimentary popcorn and pretzel bowls, and people are welcomed to order food from other nearby businesses) and you have to drive on to get to another place (just what you need after drinking). The sign is also really small and hard to see from the street (a usually busy University Drive). 

My girlfriend and I decided to split a sampler. It had seven or eight of Sleepy Dog's beers. A few of them were alright, but the lighter beers were way too light, and most of the dark beers were low on flavor.

Thank you Pomegranate Cafe, Russell, and all of PC's other staff members for helping me forget, for an hour or so, that I was feeling very much under-the-weather.  l was feeling elated about my upcoming delights, I totally forgot how awful I must have looked wearing yoga pants, a Life is Good tee, a hooded zip pullover, and glasses.  What a bum!  Surprisingly, business was bustling this morning-- I've never seen PC full of people, and get this, there was a LINE waiting to order!  Because most of the tables were taken indoors, it was very noisy, so I took this chance to hide my I'm-sick-as-a-dog bum from the beautiful people and eat OUTDOORS.  But first, I had to place my order.

Since I'd already perused the menu online, I knew I was going to have the French toast, no powdered sugar, please, like I usually do, but I wanted to try something new.  The basic breakfast (egg, toast, jam, and fruit) enticed, but I quickly drew towards Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit.  I also thought I'd either try a smoothie or an elixir ($8 each), but the menu online stated to ask for an elixir menu for options.  There was only one, and it was a ""female hormonal concoction"" with something, I lost track, since I didn't need help with my hormones, thank you very much.  (""Not that there's anything wrong with that."")  $8 saved.  The smoothie I wanted to try contained pomegranate juice, which I correctly suspected had one or more unwanted ingredients, and for me, that was ""grape seed oil extract.""  (So glad I spotted those juice bottles in front of the cash register.)  Good- I was able to hang onto $8 of my money.  Last, but not least, I ordered a cappucino (Cartel Coffee) and a glass of water without cucumber.  I again reiterated that I did not want powdered sugar on the French toast, which I was told would take twenty or twenty-five minutes to be ready, since they'd run out of the bread and the next batch was in the oven.  I said it was worth waiting for, so I don't mind, and besides, I'll have the kamut toast and almond butter.  As I paid for my three items, I was told that my food will be out in about 30 minutes, which took me by surprise, but I was in no mood to make a fuss, especially when I needed to secure an empty table before someone else snatched it!

I found one outdoors, but it needed bussing.  No problem, as I found a shy and cute associate to help me.  One thing I really like about frequenting vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free venues, is how most, if not all, of the staff members are so humble, and are good-natured.  Another thing is that these venues tend to look so hippy-chic, colorful, eclectic, and FUN!  I loved the different swaths of colorful curtains, brightly-painted tables and chairs, whimsical dinnerware, and that was indoors!  Outside, I found a mosaic two-top with mismatched chairs- I sat on the one without the morsel of food on its seat.

The food didn't take quite as long as 30 minutes.  The cappucino http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw#b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw took a few minutes to arrive, and so did the lovely-tasting city water, nicely contained in a lidless canning jar.  (There's a reason cucumber slices are used to ""flavor"" the water, folks!)  It was about ten minutes after I started sipping my coffee that the Banana bread French toast arrived http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw#ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw, but it was sprinkled with powdered sugar!  However, Russell did not hesitate in taking it back and bringing another.  What terrific service!  The Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit plate stayed, however, so I was happy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g#s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g  Still happy, even when I found out that the almond butter was the raw variety-- I don't particularly like its flavor, or lack thereof, and I only buy and enjoy the roasted kind.  It's a good thing I am not allergic to chia (still experimenting), sesame, and sunflower seeds, for while the menu did not mention these were included, one certainly could not avoid their presence on this dish!  It's also a good thing they were, since they gave the bland-tasting almond butter much-needed flavor.  The fun textures on this dish also gave my mouth something to be happy about!  The Banana bread French toast arrived about 5 minutes later, and what a marvel that was! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg#vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg  The French toast had the PERFECT crunch on the outside, a gorgeous pound-cake-meets-angel-cake consistency on the inside, and a wonderful roasted-banana scent filled the air around my face that soon delighted my taste buds!  The strawberry-rhubarb jam and agave pancake syrup added lovely velvety coats of sweetness and colors, as well.  I could've eaten the entire dish!

We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken and we were given a big bowl of tortilla chips and some salsa.  The chips were eh' but the salsa was pretty good because it did have some heat to it.

Our waitress was fast and friendly so no complaints there.

As far as the menu is concerned, I'm not really sure what to make of it.  My guess is this place is trying to be a typical Scottsdale restaurant that tries to do a fresh take on old cuisine.  Blue Agave's goal was probably to take a bunch of typical ""Mexican"" dishes and combine them with a Californian and New Mexican flair.  Combine that with some gringo stuff in a Scottsdale joint trying to be trendy and there you have Blue Agave.

The food:

*Tortilla Soup - I loved it.  I am told that this isn't ""real"" tortilla soup but I don't care.  I love it a bit thick/creamy and not watery.  I thought it was perfect.  Plenty of chicken and plenty of spice.

*Chicken Lettuce Wraps - These are basically chicken tacos without the shell.  Definitely a healthier option which is probably why my wife ordered them as a meal.  Anyway, it was actually pretty good but a tad bit bland.

*Stuffed Relleno - How can a spicy, cheesy, meaty thing NOT be good?  This was in no way a healthy option but I love stuffed chillies so what the heck.

The food here is pretty ok for what it is.  The quality of it is eh' as is the ambiance of the place.  I would like to try more of their menu but there are tons of other Mexican/New Mexican/Baja type places in the valley that are far superior I would visit first.",review,BFZHdg2TRrgw56CyqkSryA

After telling my husband that I was feeling particularly inclined to eat either Mexican ( a rare occurrence for me ) or Chinese food, he suggested Chino Bandido.  After a little bit of research on the internets I decided that there was something suitable for me there.

At first glance, the place looks seedy.  Upon closer inspection, it just looks dirty.  That didn't really bother me as some of the best food can come from the not so best looking conditions.  They haven't been shut down, so how bad can it be?  The way of ordering food here is a bit too complicated, you feel like you're taking a pop quiz you aren't prepared for.  The little sheet of paper you use to order just doesn't have very good instructions.  However, the girls working here were all very nice and helpful, and more than willing to dole out samples to anyone interested.  

I finally ordered the Jade Red Chicken with plain fried rice.  The rice definitely seemed like a fusion of the Asian and Mexican with the style being Chinese, but the flavor being very Mexican.  The chicken itself was rather tough, definitely not a high quality.  The crispiness of the batter was really good though.  The sauce that makes this Jade Red was described as sweet and sour with a kick.  Well, I missed the sweet and sour flavor.  It was more along the lines of just kick.  Now, I understand I have a low tolerance for spices, but this was over the top for me.  I will be back next time I am congested.  The snickerdoodle they served with your meal is the bomb though.  Yum.

Overall, I am not really impressed.  Creative, but not something I'm really feeling.  I think I may check out the Chandler location to give this place another shot.

Johnny Chu himself stopped by to see how we were doing at one point, amidst all the festive chaos. The atmosphere was perfect for a couple of hours of drinks and conversation, with an appetizer for some added flavor. Having been here once before for a private event, I was fully prepared to walk in, walk out, and give Sens 3 stars based on what I thought I knew. When I judge a place on Yelp, though, most of my rating comes from my emotions. There isn't any one element that leads automatically to a 5-star score. It's the totality of the owner's creation and how it makes its customers feel. That's why we go out to eat, after all. Not to stuff food in our faces. We can do that at home, or at McDonald's. The purpose is simply to make us feel good. Sens accomplished that this Friday, hands down. So 5 stars it is.",review,d3MxUXS1b6U2P_gGuCO1-A

I prefer supporting the more local ventures. So I stopped in on my walk in to work the other morning. It was empty but I was eagerly greeted as I made my way to the counter. I ordered the large Americano, and waited. As I waited I enjoyed the simplicity of the shop. I didn't see any sweets or treats to go with my java, and then I look down to notice that the espresso machine had a part being held up by a plastic cup that had crushed under the weight of this part and water was dripping on the counter.

I finally got my coffee and went on my way. Served very hot, as far as the flavor, ehh the jury is still out.

Sure it's a little off the beaten path, but it's worth the drive. 

Home to the Mariners and Padres, this truly is another state of the art spring training facility. Parking is $5 but there's plenty of it and I really enjoyed the multiple golf carts driving around that offer visitors a ride to and from their car, especially on an uncommonly hot day like last Saturday. We first went to the sales window and upon realizing that will call was on the other side, a staffer driving a golf cart gave us a friendly ride to the other side. Once we picked up our tickets, we were inside and to our seats within minutes. 

The stadium is really nice. I don't think there's a bad seat in the entire ballpark, including on the grass. I will say that if you like to sit in the shade, plan accordingly because not many of the seats are graced with shade. I noted that the only seats with shade are the ones directly below the announcer's boxes, even the ones under the overhang get some sunlight from sun peaking through the roof. But, just lather on that sunscreen and you'll be good to go!                     

I really enjoyed the crowd here at Peoria Sports Complex. Some of the stadiums can get extremely rowdy during the game and for some are the front for spring break 2011 (I don't even think they realize a game is going on). However, the crowd here was much more relaxed so I think this is a good ""off the beaten path"" stadium where people aren't quite as rowdy and instead are just there to have a couple beers and a good time in the sun watching baseball. 

Now let's move on to the food. I probably could have eaten my way through this stadium and I would have been happy. I saw a frozen yogurt stand, a flat bread stand, funnel cake, kettle corn, Hawaiian noodles, BBQ, gyros, pizza...you name it, this stadium has it. It's like a carnival with a baseball game in the background. While I mentally ate everything mentioned above, I psychically only had half of a hot dog and when I say half, I mean half of a foot-long sausage which technically means I had a whole hot dog. The sausage was really god and barbecued fresh in front of our very eyes. I highly suggest trying it out..and then have some funnel cake and maybe some fry bread and maybe some fro yo? You'll roll out of there but who cares when there is so much good ballpark food to choose from!

It was a sunny (typical!) afternoon. A Saturday. I was with my father and brother on our way to lunch. The destination: Cracker Barrel. It wasn't my choice and I won't begin to tell you how horrid the food there is. Let's just say it earned the moniker Crapper Barrel and will forever be known as the worst place on earth to eat. 

Of course, if you've been to Mesa Riverview, you know that nearby the CB is this HUGE sporting goods store. Otherwise known as Bass Pro Shops. It was, of course, opening weekend. 

My dad and brother dragged me inside. 

Talk about retail meets theme park meets playground meets the wild outdoors. When you first walk in, you aren't sure what your eyes should settle upon. The flashy boats? The 4-wheelers? The huge fish tank? The gun room? The arcade games? 

From sling shots to dog collars, we looked it all over. We even spotted a camo bikini. Absurd. I even mounted a couple 4-wheelers and pretended I was flying down the dunes. (It reminded me past years when I used to have a 4-wheeler at my disposal.) I also climbed in a boat and tried out the seats, imagining myself out on the lake, pole in hand. It was reminiscent of the many fishing trips I took with Gramps.

Between joking with my Dad and being in sheer bewilderment of the enormity of this place, I had fun. I hate to admit it, but it's true. From admiring the wood furniture to snapping a camera pic of a bull's testicles, I had fun! Granted, I don't so much attribute that to the store.

* Burger Brulee - Interesting and pretty good - I give them credit for trying something different, but it really wasn't my thing.  The burnt sugar on the bun gave it a crunchy texture but having a sweetness to a burger is weird to me.

I've probably driven by Breadcrafters over 3.000 times since I moved to Phoenix.  It's in an unassuming little shopping center on Tatum across the street from PV Mall.  I noticed the sign but never thought twice about going in until my friend Deborah recently told me that they have wonderful sandwiches and salads that are perfect for picking up when you're on the run.

So, instead of trusting Deborah 100% (I don't know her THAT well yet), I sent my mom in to try Breadcrafters when she asked me where she should go for lunch during her last visit.  It passed the 'mom test' with flying colors... my mom loved it - she said it was perfect!

Today was my turn... and needless to say, I was extremely impressed!  The staff was really sincere, friendly and helpful.  When I walked in, I smelled fresh bread and I saw several cases full of not only bread, but sandwiches, salads, and baked goods too!  Everything looked awesome!  I looked at the menu and noticed that prices were reasonable and they offered daily specials including soup/sandwich combo and 'the daily double' where you pick two different items to make your own combo.  It took me a few minutes. but I decided to design my own sandwich off the menu... I went with turkey, lettuce, tomato. avocado., sprouts, and spicy mustard on multi-grain alsatian bread.  It came with my choice of sides (I went with coleslaw) and a pickle.

If you've read my reviews, you know I don't usually go into detail about the food more than saying what I ordered, liked, didn't like. etc... however, I have to make an exception on this one.  The sandwich may sound like any other sandwich you could pick up anywhere, but this sandwich was special!  Every bite I took, I tasted all of the ingredients.  It was balanced perfectly!  Just the right amount of mustard and avocado spread evenly on the bread, fresh and juicy turkey. crisp lettuce, and ripe tomato.  Yum!

I was there after 2 for a late lunch expecting this random place to be empty... but I was wrong.  The place was hopping!  I noticed that people were eating outside (it was a beautiful day) and that Breadcrafters is DOG FRIENDLY!  I also noticed that many people came in just to buy freshly-baked bread.  Not a bad idea - I'll have to remember that for next time we're entertaining!

I overheard Angela. the (new) owner, tell a customer that the bread sold like crazy today, so I imagine the best selection is first thing in the morning... It may have been my first visit to Breadcrafters but it will not be my last.  See you there!",review,j5HLcBru7FEirYJPbKFVWA

A place that once welcomed me with open arms as an 11 year old girl 11 years ago has painfully tossed me aside in favor of pandering to the new 11 year olds.  I used to be valued and loved here.  I was given gifts and great deals at the concessions.  Funny thing is, I never paid for my ticket back then.  Things have changed.  Unfortunately, they have changed for the worse.  

My husband and I actually got engaged here, that's how much I used to love it here.  No, it wasn't on the Jumbotron, my now husband was lied to.  He was told that he would get his proposal to me on the big screen and even a special video to document.  Shortly before then, they canceled on him, crushing his dream of making my dream come true.  Instead, I was treated to a much more intimate, beautiful and heartfelt proposal.  It still happened at Chase Field, but no thanks to the organization.  This is just one of many letdowns from this place.

After we were married, we attended the games as proud season ticket holders.  It was exciting to watch this young team climb up the playoff ladder and make a good run for the series.  Unfortunately it was quite painful along the way.  We were introduced to the idiots known as Mike and Vanessa.  They add nothing more to the game other than making it an embarrassing spectacle in the world of baseball.  Then we met the Rallybacks, nothing more than glorified Hooter's girls wearing baseball apparel.  They couldn't name you one player on the team.  Sad.

One day they gave away margarita glasses to the adult crowd.  Not wanting to ignore the children who get special kid's only giveaways at every game, they made them special kids tumblers glasses.  They were way cooler and I asked to exchange my adult glass for the kids glass.  I was very rudely declined by the power hungry ticket taker.  I always felt that as a season ticket holder, I should be entitled to ALL of the giveaways, after all, I was giving a ton of money to this team.  That was out of the question.

Finally, we discontinued our season tickets.  We did this out of disgust at the way we were treated by this organization.  Our baseball buddy had injured her leg quite badly during the season and suffered a good amount every time she walked the stairs down to our seats.  We sat her on the end so she wouldn't have to be cramped or get up (we were in a very short row of 7 seats and we took up 3).  Unfortunately the other people in our row did not share the same concern for her and constantly shoved past her when they could have disturbed their own party instead.  This caused a great deal of verbal assaults on us, one even resulting in a threat of violence.  We reported this to the security and were completely ignored.  The best the team could do was move us to the opposite side of the stadium and put us in worse seats.

There are  few good things about this place.  Derrick Hall is one of them.  He immediately responded to every one of my emails, even the one where I asked if I could have the old Jeff Salazar posters since he was no longer part of the team.  I never did get those.  I appreciated his apology when I told him about the whole ""seat debacle"" but he couldn't offer me what I felt I deserved.  That's okay, because he has a whole stadium to worry about.  I still think that he is a good and decent guy with a great love for baseball.  I think he will do great with this team.  Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends.

I'm sorry, but I may not be back here.  It's like a bad breakup for me because I had such a long, loving relationship with this place despite all the bad food and the bad times.  There were lots of good times here too.  Sadly, the good is grossly outweighed by the bad.  I will miss it, but I think a swift sever is the best and only way to go.",review,0UZ31UTcOLRKuqPqPe-VBA

If you're headed to the parking lots near Lucille's and what not to head to the main strip of smaller stores, you will probably find yourself not knowing where to park in order to get to the specific store you are trying to access. You will be way off base from where you guessed you were and end up confused and lost and bitter. 

By that point, all you want to do is get the thing you came for and leave as quickly as possible. You're not going to want to stay and shop and browse or sit by the outdoor fireplace (which is on when it's hot out.. WTF).

With that being said, sometimes I still come here. Lucille's is a work favorite. BevMo is a needed stop at times and if I need to run errands at Michaels or Target after work, it's nearby.

Had planned to partake in Fleming's happy hour (had a giftcard), but came here instead when I saw how busy it was at the bar (and I didn't want to sit outside in the heat).  I knew Roy's had a quasi-HH (free edamame-- what kind of HH is that?), so I had resigned to have Roy's tasty Waimanolo (sp?) salad.  Surprise, surprise!  Roy's now offers four food items (ahi tuna, calamari, Wagyu sliders, and beef skewers!), as well as a few wines by the glass and ALL of its signature cocktails during happy hour for $5 each!  I've tried the skewers before and wasn't too impressed, but I knew the calamari was very good, so I didn't go for that (even though I really wanted to have some).  No, what I had my eye on were the Wagyu beef sliders, w/ caramelized onions and, wait... what else did I read?  Sweet potato fries??  Oh, yeah!  My name was all over this dish!  I also placed an order for chardonnay, but I changed my mind when I saw that I could try another of Roy's signature drinks-- the last ones I'd tried many, many months ago were my espresso martini and a friend's lemon martini I'd sampled.  I was doubly-excited when I spotted Roy's Hawaiian take on the classic sidecar!  This happy hour was going to be FUN!

The Fred and Ginger cocktail did NOT disappoint!  It contained Hennessy VS cognac and Domaine du Canton ginger liqueur w/ a candied ginger peel garnish served in a martini glass.  It was beautiful to behold and so very delicious to sip!  'Twas a shame I couldn't finish the whole drink-- had to save some room for the sliders and fries (and the dessert I hadn't even planned on having later on!).  I really liked the sliders-- there were two of them, one on either side of the mini-Chinese takeout box filled w/ seasoned crispy sweet potato fries.  The sliders tasted like Whoppers (back in its heyday in the early 80's) kicked up several notches (LOVED the crispy/chewy pretzel buns!), and the fries were seasoned w/ herbs and even had a bit of cheese drizzle here and there!  I would definitely order the cocktail and app again, and for $5 each, they're a steal!  

(I almost did not want to yelp about Roy's happy hour, bec. I wanted to keep this a secret for a little while.)

Thinking back, the cocktail and app would've been enough to satisfy me for the rest of the day, but I didn't really want to leave Roy's just yet ( had planned to write a review or two), so I broke down and decided to try the Chocolate souffle ($9.95), Roy's take on the chocolate lava cake, but w/ homemade vanilla bean ice cream and a raspberry coulis.  This item is baked to order, so if you are on a time limit, you should place your order in early, as it takes about 20 minutes to bake.  Was it worth the wait?  Hmm...  I liked the outer edges of the chocolate cake, which had the chewiness of a soft, fresh-baked brownie.  The lava center was definitely gooey and rich, and it tasted like hot brownie batter.  I think I'd have enjoyed the cake and its lava center a lot more if the accompanying vanilla ice cream was of a better quality.  I didn't care for its texture (not creamy enough), nor its flavor (vanilla bean specks were absent and the vanilla essence wasn't strong enough).  This dish cost as much as the app and cocktail combined, and I didn't think it was worth the price.

The Kachina Lodge resort until purchased by the Friars in 1951, Casa grounds are absolutely breathtaking and offer traditional Catholic respite, like a beautiful cylindrical chapel where the sacred Eucharist is kept and visitors can pray quietly, as well as a labyrinth, healing garden, guest rooms and swimming pool. In fact, the retreat center is available to non-Catholic -- non-Christian even -- groups for events. They really mean it when they say ""all are welcome.""

The grounds and retail area were both very charming.  We browsed their huge selection of custom olive oils, spreads and other misc. offerings.  Their selection is pretty impressive and it looks like they have some quality stuff.

I was very disappointed with the samples though.  All they had was about 5 spreads and about 15 olive oils set out for you to sample.  Now it wouldn't be that bad if they had some bread to put the spreads on or to dip in the olive oil.  Instead they gave you little wood spreader things (like small popsicle sticks) to taste the spreads and little plastic cups to taste the olive oils.  The place where they set all their olive oil samples wasn't laid out very well either.  It was just a small table with open bottles next to some little plastic cups.  The area would often get crowded as people tried to figure out what to do with little cups of olive oil.  Anyway, if you visit the QCCOM be sure to pack some bread, crackers or pretzels so you can better experience what they have.  However I guess the joke is on me because somehow I spent like $75 on olive oils and I didn't even know that was possible.

The friends my wife and I went with had been there before and said the tour wasn't really worth it so we opted out.  I probably should have experienced the tour for myself but whatever.  Maybe next time.  But the tour didn't look that impressive so I'm not that heartbroken.

We ate in their cafe for lunch and here is the breakdown:

* veggie antipasto plate - this was good

* kalamata sandwich - eh.  I got the 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad (chix ceasar - was 'eh' as well)

* dessert bruschetta (honey marscapone & nutella) - excellent!

You can eat inside but the whether was nice when I went so I sat outside.  It is a nice little area to sit, eat and ponder just how many snow birds flock to this place.  Anyway, I wish I had more to say but I just don't.  You probably get excited when you read the menu and think how wonderful the food is, but I just didn't think it was all that great.  It wasn't horrible, just not all that great.  If I were there again in the future I would absolutely give it another shot, but I'm not going to go out of my way to try it again.",review,7YYD_agS3Kb2sAx9JPkQEw

Well, things here haven't changed much at this old but busy neighborhood buffet.  Once you successfully maneuver past all the drunks wandering around in the middle of the street on Van Buren, you arrive here to find a good selection of 56 food items, not counting sauces & dressings, & for me, after paying the friendly lady up front, it was on to the Hot & Sour Soup.

Like Norm R. remarked regarding a regular haunt of mine, Best Wok Buffet, the booth seats here have worn too soft.  My favorite seating spot was available, but after landing in it I sank down until the table was at mid chest height!  Was it just trying to tell me that I need to lose some weight?     :-O     In any event, having the table up by your chin does make your soup easy to eat!

Now their fried rice was greasy, but the Egg Foo Young made up for it by being thoughtfully presented in various patty sizes, & delicious with it's rich brown gravy!  The salad area was good for a buffet this size too, & included various greens & tasty ham chunks.

There were several kinds of fish & other seafood to enjoy, plus a variety of other meat (mostly chicken) dishes.  I liked almost everything, & thought both the fried chicken & the chicken on a stick were better than average in taste.  For dessert it was chunks of various kinds of fruit, served in cream.  Yum!

The pricing is right & this smooth running place holds onto a solid 3 Star vote here!     :-)

The large building that backs up to the canal was most recently home to the Calico Cow. The floral/country decor that had provided the setting for comfort food has been replaced with red walls lined with large black and white photos of celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Rat Pack favorites.  Guests can now enjoy delicious house-made New England clam chowder and perfectly seasoned, slow cooked prime rib accompanied by live jazz or in a private dining room with a Western theme. When it cools off, I'm sure the patio will be a popular spot!

They have been open for one week and I've been there 3 times. Here are some of the things I've tried so far:

The clam chowder ($6) was a real highlight: loaded with littleneck clams, Yukon potatoes, fresh dill and double cream. This soup is not thick and corn-starchy, which usually prevents me from even considering it. 

The shrimp for the shrimp cocktail ($11) is poached in Riesling and served with a cocktail sauce spiked with cognac. 

The steak bruschetta ($12) lines crostini with thinly sliced rare filet mignon, gorgonzola and a balsamic reduction and a pairs them with a side of diced tomato, onion and basil to be applied at your own discretion.

The prime rib ($18, $20 or $22 depending on the cut size) is perfectly seasoned and not too fatty.

The chicken lahvosh ($16) is a generous serving of 2 breasts, pounded and encrusted in lahvosh crackers. Served with sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms and tomato in a chardonnay sauce. The night I had this there was not much sauce. I hear that is not the norm. There was so much chicken, though, I took one of the breasts home as leftovers and ate it cold the next day on a salad. It was even better the second day!!

Menu items are a la carte, so if you want potatoes or veggies you'll have to add those at $5 a pop but they are served family style and there is enough for at least 3 people per serving. I've tried the whipped Yukon potato that is creamy and buttery - just like mom makes! But, watch out for the potato au gratin: the table may fight over this scrumptious blend of potato, green onion and bacon loaded with Jack cheese! 

At lunchtime, there are a few more salads to choose from and sandwiches, burgers and wraps averaging $7-9. Sandwiches are served with your choice of garlic scented fries, sweet potato fries, regular fries, salt & vinegar chips cottage cheese or coleslaw. I had the roast beef au jus with garlic fries and would have liked to see a little more meat on my sandwich and a little more salt in the au jus. 

I hear great things about the blackened mahi-mahi so that's next on my list!

The owners are not new to the industry, having previously owned Jackson's in Flagstaff. A perfect match for Sunnyslope: a close family team that loves community. You'll find them making the rounds in the dining room greeting patrons and striking up conversation. And, while an upscale dining experience, there's no pretension to be found here. I wish these guys the best of luck and welcome them to the neighborhood! It's so great to have yet another choice for dining out in Sunnyslope!",review,GeHwru6TVDyVErFc92Nn2w

So I was kind of down on the place from the beginning. Anyway, we had a group of 11 people and for a good amount of time we were the only people in the restaurant. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and they also brought out their bread. I think the bread was the best part of the whole restaurant, the garlic butter was really good. The calamari was good too, it had kind of a spicy sauce, so I liked that. 

I ended up ordering the chicken princess, which is chicken in a wine sauce with asparagus on top. The waiter said 'Chicken princess for the princess.' Really? Really? It's not like I'm 10 years old. Who says that? I found that really weird. And then when he brought it out he said it again... I found it very strange. Other than that the service was fine. But come on. 

So on to the food. My chicken was really good, but the sides that came with it were not good. It came with gnocchi in alfredo and with some veggies. The alfredo was a bit strange, and I don't think it complimented the chicken, they should have used a different sauce because the two white sauces kind of clashed. Also, the veggies had way too much lemon squeezed on them. They just tasted like lemon.... not so good. I tried what my dad ordered (lamb shank) and I was not a fan, but he seemed to like it. I heard the eggplant was just ok, and that the clam sauce was good. I also tried some of their Caesar salad and that was pretty good, the croutons had a nice flavor.

""Wear Pink"".

Because the guest of honor loves pink. And everything else at her shindig was going to be pink. The food. The beverages. The flamingos. As well as most of the people there after they've been standing around in the sun for a few hours (although I myself become more of a raw umber/burnt sienna type). 

But I didn't own anything pink. Or even a shirt that was red and white that I could say was pink deconstructed.  I'd been working and studying nonstop all weekend and could only be at the shindig for a little while before I had to continue typing away, but I didn't want to be that schlump who showed up in his typical lame black tshirt.

So I got in my car, on my way to the party with absolutely no effing idea where I was going to get myself a pink shirt on the fly. My brain was first telling me Macys. And then Mervyns. Scratch that. Mervyns doesn't exist anymore. Target? Too far. Ok, Marshall's.

But then I suddenly noticed Goodwill out of the corner of my eye. Somewhere in my brain, the word ""Duh"" flashed on and off several times.

I pulled into the lot and walked in. A lot of commotion inside, but everything pretty well organized. Clothes racks everywhere. Other non-clothes stuff to the sides and back. One woman with at least 15 dresses on her arm, frantically looking like she was buying half the store. Could have been Jessica. You never know.

I made a bee-line for the men's shirts. Then a bee-line for the XLs, where I saw everything was organized by color. 

Awesome. 

As if to say, ""Hi Mr. Man. We know you have no patience for browsing and want to buy one thing and get out of here within 30 seconds. So here, we have organized everything almost monosyllabically just for your convenience: You. Man. Size. Color. Buy. Grunt.""

Thus I spotted the pinks in no time, found a pink Oxford that didn't look overrun with car grease and ketchup stains, and then looked at the price tag ($6!).

Sold. 

I changed right there in parking lot and came to the party with a pink shirt on, all thanks to Goodwill and my briefest flash of brilliant thinking, and was happily greeted by a birthday girl wearing a bikini and giant pink eyelashes. 

Which was all good, and I was glad I made the effort, except for the fact it was 5 billion degrees outside and I started rapidly melting. I then looked around. Everyone else was in bathing suits or shorts whereas I, the village idiot, was standing there in jeans and a pink Oxford shirt.

But who said Goodwill gave a discount on logic?

I admit, I need to step up my cooking game a bit, and I think this place gave me some motivation to do so.

I had never heard of this place before, and when my friend had mentioned it, I admit, I was intrigued. A store just for spices? My brain lit up at this idea. Honestly,  I didn't know what to expect when I entered, but I can tell you, this is one heck of an interesting place.  Upon entering the place smelled like a spice store, but in a good way.  Clean, well organized with a huge selection of just about every spice possible.  

Each bottle comes not only with the ingredients, but ideas on how to use it as well.  Some of the spices seemed unique to me, and I found it interesting to see what things can be used to spice up dishes.  The spices themselves come in a variety of sizes and ranging in prices.  I saw some that were just a few dollars for a small container, and over $40 for others.  The jars they sell them in are reuseable, so if you buy a jar of a certain spice, you can purchase the bag to reuse the same bottle. I like this idea. Plus, they also sell empty bottles in the corner of the store if you want to bottle your own spices if you should have a garden at home, or make a special concoction.

Overall, I was really impressed with this place.  Well organized, staff was friendly, prices were fair and there was an ample selection of items to choose from of all kinds.

There was a large party in the back, they mentioned that they were in town for a wedding so I am guessing they must have walked over from the Pointe Hotel.  (this explained no cars in the lot).

It is set up like a breakfast buffet, you pay $15 or $16/person and eat whatever in the buffet.  The choices are limited and not that good.  The best part was the made to order omlets and that is it.  Even the sauasage and bacon seemed to taste off.  HOW does that happen?  So the buffet had scrambled eggs (don't eat those-ick), sausage, bacon, french toast, syrup, cereal, fruit.  oh and the omlets-- best bet are the omlets. 

Service was slow, only one gal running around for the whole place and even though not busy when we got there, there was still a huge group in the back, a small group up front and us.  Then another large group came in as we were finishing up.

Now while, you might not have as much to choose from like other major cities, auditoriums like ASU Gammage make a solid effort to bring in a variety of Broadway shows and other performances throughout the year. And for that, I applaud them -- or in this case give them four stars. 

I wish that more residents appreciated ASU Gammage and gave it a chance. With performances like Phantom of the Opera, Le Mis, Hair, Rent, etc ... this auditorium brings the best of the best to town. When I was 10 I a say Robert Goulet perform in Camelot. And I've seen so many other shows throughout the years I won't list them all. However, every time I've gone to a show, it's been a theatrical and exciting experience and true to what I hoped it would be. 

Besides the programming ASU Gammages brings in, the property itself is pretty neat. It has extremely unique architecture and might have something to do with being diseigned by Frank Lloyd Wright himself. If you look at it, it really is architecture genius and the auditorium holds a lot of people too. The inside is straight out of the 70's and has a cool and artsy vibe. 

Buyer be warned that if you buy tickets on the third tier, you should plan on bringing binaculars and going for the sound and not so much to see it. It's sort of like being in the bleachers at a football game and if it's a nice show, then does it really matter where your sitting as long as you scored tickets? Originally, I was told by the box office that the second level in the center has the best seats. I do not agree. I made the mistake of listening and opting for those tickets instead of orchestra (because the box office should know right?) Instead, I squinted throughout an entire performance. So if you have the opportunity, always go for the orchestra tickets. Always. And lovers of the theater know that contrary to the belief that the first row is always the best, the the middle center rows of an auditorium are normally best for watching a Broadway show. If you end up sitting in the front row, I guarantee you'll receive a shower and witness just how caked on that makeup looks from close up. But like I said, anywhere in the auditorium is good if the performance is right.",review,ohxd8La86GdC_3vgwBWLHA

I liked it, it's not exactly what you would expect, but that's nice sometimes. I ended up ordering the chicken caliente at the waiter's suggestion and my mom ordered the baja enchiladas. So my dish is this huge butterflied chicken breast where one side has chipotle cream sauce and one side has jalapeno sauce and it's served over mashed potatoes with just a couple little quesadilla wedges. The chicken was decent, it was spicy! (which was a good thing) but the chicken itself was a bit chewy.

Estimates say that the pizza industry is worth somewhere around $30 billion dollars annually with over 60,000 pizzerias in the U.S. alone. Better get on that treadmill because each one of us apparently consumes around 23 pounds of pizza per year.  Who says were the chubbiest nation?

With those staggering numbers it's no surprise we have so many pizza joints vying for their piece of the pie. If you have any doubt, just go to famed Pizzeria Bianco on pretty much any night of the week they're open and expect a 2 hour wait minimum, obsession, oh yeah. 

Over the past few years I've chowed down on slices from The Parlor in Phoenix, Liberty Market in Gilbert and now my latest favorite La Bocca Urban Pizzeria in Tempe. Situated along bustling Mill Avenue, like it's namesake, La Bocca exudes hip-urban-cool without being pretentious or douchey. 

Outside LB there's a spacious patio that's perfect for sipping wine and watching the hunky college boys and girls saunter by. Inside the space is modern, dark and relaxed with low key music playing in the background and old foreign films projecting on the back wall. If you can, call ahead and reserve the orange banquette by the kitchen, probably the most comfortable seat in the house. 

Bruschetta Planks ($12) come 4 in an order, but with so many outstanding choices it's hard to choose. Smoked prosciutto, fig, mascarpone cheese and truffle oil was balanced with salty and sweet, but left me wanting more. Pulled pork, housemade pesto and roasted red pepper was on the bland side, though the roasted garlic, goat cheese, arugula and balsamic popped with flavor and texture.  I'd also suggest the smoked sockeye salmon with capers and chef's tartar sauce, reminded me of a dinner version of lox and bagels. 

Another great way to start might be with the Med Plate ($14). This is a huge plate filled with basil hummus, babaganoush, warm feta cheese, roasted peppers, queen creek olives, artisan toast, and house made flat bread. The consistency of the hummus was a little thick for my taste but still quite good paired with the creamy feta and salty olives. 

I was actually surprised as to how good the pizza really is here. The first taste of the Bocca Trio ($13) revealed with high quality ingredients and charred chewy crust. Topped with crushed San Marzano tomatoes, pepperoni, salami, Schreiner's ""sicilian"" sausage, 
mozzarella, fontina and olives LB's gas fired oven does an amazing job of caramelizing these toppings into a smoky and slightly sweet mouth parade. 

There are 7 pizzas to choose from but if you don't see something that suits your fancy, build your own pizza ($8) or calzone ($9). At a $1-$3 each, toppings can add up really fast so select wisely from their 30 or so choices.

Last night, I got the opportunity, and it was actually more interesting and less ""alcoholic bar"" than I expected. 

When I walked in, I was drawn to the busy looking atmosphere, all the games, and lack of music which was actually weird. We saddled up at the bar and the first thing I noticed was a lack of draft, which the bartender referred to as ""dirty beer."" Ok, we aren't off to a good start, no music and no drafts. Just after, the bartender poured exactly one jigger full of Jack Daniels for my Jack and Coke. She was very slow, methodical, and really really new. I had to help her find Jack Daniels on her computer screen. ""It's Bourbon!"" I proclaimed, and when she hit the BOURBON button, she asked what I ordered again. I was half tempted to say well bourbon, but I was honest with her. This place is a mess I thought quietly to myself, and then I turned around and noticed a big screen TV with FREE ROCK BAND 2 on XBOX. OK, all is forgiven... everything, all of it, I'm going to play Rock Band now, kthx. 

I played drums, Erika played guitar, and Cokie the Clown (I don't know his real name) was on the vocals.

Very nice menu with traditional Indian favorites, plus some of the uncommon items that I've found in cities (such as Chicago) that offer more diversity in Indian cuisine.  For example, I don't normally see Bhindi Masala, Mushroom Palak, and my favorite - Bombay Aloo (beautiful cumin seed spiced potatoes).  

Tandoori breads are reasonably priced, which is certainly a change from the norm in the West Valley.

High scores for concept and convenience to where I live and Downtown in general. The food flavor, quality and authenticity is there. I will have to say the tortillas were good, I have had better but I have definitely had MUCH worse. 

On this trip I ordered the guacamole and Pork Chile Verde, which came with rice, beans and 2 kinds of salsa and tortilla. I also chose the fresh limeade to drink. Total came to around $13.
The guacamole is superb (as I sit at my desk finishing up the guac and salsa from last night for brunch). The freshness comes right through, from the fresh garlic, jalapenos onions, cilantro, tomatoes...chopped perfectly...about as good as I make at home (which is definitely a compliment). The salsas, tasty...the verde has to be my favorite of the two. The beans were simple and topped with queso fresco and the rice seasoned simply was also quite nice. 
Now for the chile verde, yum! Well seasoned pork simmered with green chiles was tender and shreaded with just the right amount of heat for the general crowd (maybe even a bit spicy for some but don't change it). I would take a bit of guac and a scoop of pork and add it into a piece of tortilla....mmmmm. The limeade was fresh and very sweet....they could have added a little more water to it and it would have extended their batch and it would be perfect.

Now. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm a sushi fanatic. It's gone on way too long to just be a phase. The service is great here, the sushi comes out quick, and it will always up the rating of your day by at least 2 points. If you want to get the full effect, sit at the bar.

I've eaten in and ordered out several times and no matter what my food's ready just when it's supposed to be. The nigiri is oh so good. Thinking about it now makes me lean towards Hana tonight. Anyone game? The basic rolls are anything but basic here, all of them made with love.. and fish that want you to enjoy them. 

Sadly I admit I was turned off by the specialty rolls my first visit, because they weren't wrapped very tightly and I didn't look very lady-like while eating them. But I've gotten over that. Sometimes I'm not a lady. And they were delicious. I'll deal with it. You should too.

Hana's a small joint. Sometimes there's a little bit of a line. Nevertheless though, it never seems to ever be so crowded anyone gets annoyed. The staff is efficient, and the sushi is worth it.",review,h6jfMpTZpNduLG0wE2tbaw

This was my first trip to Vitamin T.  Having read the so-so reviews I decided to check it out for myself.  
Walking in I didn't know where to start I had to weave my way through patrons standing and eating at the oak barrels randomly placed and the others in line filling up their little salsa cups at the salsa bar.  I awkwardly made my way to the flat screen menu.  
Torn between the Sonora Dog and the Caramelos I went with the Barbacoa Caramelo and an order of Guacamole (no drink $8.74) .  I preceeded to wait, initially awkwardly close to the kitchen/bar and some folks eating on barrels then decided to get my own salsas.  As my number was called I had to again become rather intimate with the standing diners positioned around the barrels, back up to the front.  They provide sacks to pack up your food for take out.  I threw everything in and again weaved my way through the barrels and people yet again.   

The food....
The caramelos are served in 2s grilled flat with 2 tortillas each then folded in half, the filling of cheese and meat are generous. The barbacoa is lightly seasoned and tasty.  From the salsa bar I choose the salsa verde, roasted serrano peppers and the small batch of red salsa in the back.  Here the red is better than the green.  And the roasted serranos are nicely spicy. 
The guacamole order comes with chips.  Not home made but tasty. The guac itself is quite lemony with garlic, chunks of tomato onion and cilantro and a flavor more akin to black pepper...meh it is ok.",review,WYk91WPklqRWuk9z9DsPDw

I had a great time meeting some fellow Yelpers and getting to try out a new place. I had seen this restaurant on Check Please! on PBS so it was already on my super-long and always growing ""to try"" bookmark list. 

We started with spring rolls which tasted super fresh and delicious. They were the non-fried kind and there is nothing worse than when those get a little old and the rice paper starts to get crunchy instead of chewy. But these were perfect and came with a yummy dipping sauce. Also, there were huge whole shrimps in them instead of chopped or minced as some Asian restaurants use. The hubby got a beef noodle dish and I ordered Pho. Both were very tasty. I liked the fact that they gave you ample amounts of (very fresh) herbs and condiments to add to the soup to your liking. It reminded me of eating menudo at my MIL's house. I was also very happy to see that they included sliced jalapenos on the garnish plate... even though I didn't eat them outright as did some others at the table, I added them to the broth and let them steep a bit and it gave the perfect amount of spice to the pho. The bowl was so huge that I couldn't finish it all but it was really good and left me with a satisfied but not too stuffed feeling. 

Since we got there late, I had ordered hurriedly so I was very surprised when I went up to pay and both our meals including tax and tip was still less than $10. Amazing! I seriously can not remember the last time I paid so little for a good meal. I pretty much never come to this part of town but if it was closer to where we live I would definitely make this place part of our regular rotation.

Durant's has not departed from that era, and I'm glad it hasn't.

I would barely put Durant's in the top 10 with stars like Donovan's, Mastro's, BLT, J&G, etc. But Durant's isn't all about the steak, it's about the experience, one every phoenician should encounter at least once in their lifetime. The owners aren't the least bit accommodating either, as they don't have to be. The restaurant fills up almost every night.

The beer menu offered selections from various countries. Nothing on tap appealed to me, so I went with the Sam Smith's Nut Brown. Very good. I had never had it before. That is probably my beer of choice at the British Open. I'd like to try the Oatmeal Stout, too. 

I don't think I'd go out of my way to frequent the B.O. Pub. It's in an obscure and generic retail plaza. That doesn't bother me so much as the ""mediocre"" vibe I got while sitting at the table.

SECOND HELPINGS:
(summary)

I sat at the bar this time. The service was faster. I perused the menu with my date and our friend. My date and I sampled a couple beers. I had the Whitbread Ale. It was okay. But... alas... COULD IT BE? Yes. It was Love At First Sip when I tried the Heather Ale from Scotland. This ale is aromatic and is made with lavender. Uhm, could you want anything else? I savored every sip and made the declaration that I love this pub for this ale alone -- and that I don't know if I can get this anywhere else. 

While at the bar, we got ""troubled"" to sign a petition to make St. Pat's Day a national holiday. For handing over our hancocks, we got free pins and pens. Nice.

ST. PATRICK'S DAY:
(a short story of celebration)

As luck would have (luck of the Irish?), my friend and I touched on the British, Scottish and Irish in an hour's time - not to mention grabbed the last table when we walked in shortly after 5 p.m. 

We came to the BritOpen, for I wanted my friend to try the Heather Ale, and I selfishly wanted to be part of a celebration at what could pass as a St. Patrick's Day-friendly establishment. So, we sat among other St. Pat's fans, while we drank one of the best ales either of us has ever had. We got asked if we wanted to order a Killian's, since they were $2 and you'd get a free shot glass with your order. Plus a bag of malts to try. Interesting. After the Heather Ale, my friend ordered a Killian's at the bar, where they weren't handing out the freebies. Bummer. We did manage to track down a couple free shot glass - for what it's worth. 

We were about to leave when the Irish music stopped. We turned and saw a ""band"" of bagpipers and drummers and the like start playing outside the pub, framed in the open doorway. Then they walked through the crowd to stand near the jukebox/TV screen to play some songs. It was incredible! My friend said, ""I feel like my homeland is calling."" She is, after all, a beautiful Scottish lass. 

After their rendition of ""Amazing Grace,"" we made our subtle exit. That's when I knew I had to re-Yelp this place. After all, bagpipes? Heather Ale? Good prices? Close to work and where I live?

Yeah, I will definitely be hanging out here again...and again... and again!

It was one of those nights when every drinking party ends in a fight.  A desert wind was blowing through the streets that night.  It was a hot wind that pulled insistently at your clothes and made the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  The streets were quieter than a dead cat under the guardrail aside a moonlit mountain road.

I was wearing my olive drab shorts and a black ""Kill Your Television"" t-shirt, I was sober and I didn't care who knew it.  I was everything an after-work regional manager ought to be and I was calling on Best of Italy.  She was exacting, charming and ruthless in the size of her slices.  I was feeling like a kid that likes to pull the legs off of spiders.  No more sense of morals than a downtrodden puppy.

She's a grifter, a voice barked from the back of my mind.  Maybe she is, I thought, but what does this five-dollar special want?  Behind the flash, behind the smile, was there nothing but poison under that sauce?  I had to know, even if it meant the big sleep by morning.

I tried her slices and they were good.  No, they were more than good and held that inner truth.  You know the truth I'm talkin' about.  The truth that makes you aware of just how aware you are. You know the world belongs to men like you, men who act as if it's a right to great pizza.  Pizza like this.  The truth that tells you the world would be a better place and not too dull to live in if there were more pizza like this around.  Because you're a part of it now, see?  The crust and the sauce and the cheese and the toppings...they're in you now and you can't go back.",review,D_VXbq6sCuqXuBbdPo9zpA

For the donut connoisseur in you I will make some comparisons.  The Bosa glazed, when fresh, certainly rivals Krispy Kreme's glazed donut.  It has less of a sugary coating than Krispy Kreme's, it is larger in circumference and slightly doughier.  In fact, the doughiness of the Bosa is somewhat reminiscent of something you might find at a state fair, though not as heavy.

The Bosa compares favorably with the Dunkin' Donuts glazed varietal.  Indeed, it is far fresher and wholesome tasting than any glazed I've had from the big D.

Not sure if publicly advertised as we received a card in the mail since we have a membership.  This particular event was $60 a ticket.  That bought a tour, food, 2 drinks, music, and seating for the fireworks.

I'm not quite sure what the tour was supposed to entail as we got quite the thunderstorm, and all the guides were improvising to keep people indoors as much as possible.  I believe it was a modified Insights tour.   Our tour guide actually looked nervous, as if she wasn't sure the roof would not cave in!  The rain offered a very different perspective.  We know the living room leaks:)  It was quite spectacular actually.  Food and entertainment was indoors.  As we understand, this was not the case last year, and it was supposedly pretty dang hot.  The food was a light meal (appetizer, barbecue sliders, and dessert).  The rain cleared in time for the fireworks around the Valley and dropped the temperature considerably making for a beautiful evening.  You can actually watch several shows at once.  Although the fireworks are all at a distance, it is quite amazing to see several shows simultaneously against the city lights, and in our case, intermingled with lightning.  Awesome.  I wish the entertainment had moved outdoors, however, to drown out the loud-mouthed, know-it-all next to us.  Can't have everything I guess.

Every tour we have taken has been informative.  We have enjoyed all of the guides, and each offers little tidbits of info on Wright's work, his life, and his personality that you won't have heard before.  When we purchased a membership, tours were only available May through September, I believe.  Now, they have a wider variety of tours available year-round.  I would HIGHLY recommend tours in the cooler weather as some of the living areas are not cooled, and even the ones that are cooled are still quite warm.

I always knew that when the time was right, I'd have the Herb Box cater a party for me... and the time finally came.  We had about 40 people over at our house on the Thursday night before our wedding.  It was primarily our friends that flew in from out of town early and we really wanted to entertain.  So I reached out to Robert, Director of Catering, and explained what we were thinking about.  

He responded in no time at all and he was extremely professional as we went back and forth a few times on pricing, menu, etc... the outcome was perfect.  We had a buffet style dinner including a chef and two buffet attendants.  Robert and Mary came over to the house a few days before to do a walk-through, and go over details.  

On the day of our event, the team came early and went above and beyond, even running to the store for us to pick up lemons and limes.  I know you're dying to know what our menu was, aren't you?  Okay - I'll share!  Here you go:
-Urban Market Salad with watercress, red pepper, dried corn, sugared pecans, avocado, and blue cheese vinaigrette (dressing on the side)
-Citrus & Rum Free-Range Chicken with watercress, pear-gorgonzola salsa
-Alaskan Salmon with maple-ginger glaze
-Asparagus couscous with feta and mint
-Grilled vegetable feast with farmers goat cheese and herbs
-and of course my favorite, the Signature Sweet Potato Chips dusted with mild curry

We arrived at the above menu after looking through around eight pages worth of gourmet menu items that are all appealing possibilities if you choose to use the Herb Box to cater your event.

It's within 10 to 15 minutes driving distance from probably over a million people in the Valley. 5 minutes from downtown Phx. 10 minutes from downtown Tempe. 15 minutes from Ahwatukee. Granted, our kick-ass highway system plays a role in that convenience. But convenient it is, unlike most airports of similar or larger sized cities.

In 12 months you'll be able to park in your suburb or have someone drive 5 minutes to the closest light rail stop, and the Metro will take you straight to Sky Harbor. (To be accurate, it'll take you to one last shuttle stop, and a shuttle will pick you up and take you to Sky Harbor; a direct connection is being constructed for the future). 

The terminals generally suck except for Terminal 4, which is okay. I can remember at least 2 occasions when I got drunk-dialed by friends from Terminal 4. Each time they were passing through Phoenix with no intention of letting me know, had some extra time, sidled up to one of the Terminal 4 bars, and *BAM* they were sloshed on bloody marys and suddenly wanted to catch up with yours truly. 

Thumbs up on the free wifi. 

The hourly parking garages are comfortably close to the terminals with minimal walking involved. The long-term lots are more of a pain in the ass to deal with but that's the nature of the beast. They do have air-conditioned lobbies and garage parking though. 

Granted, it may be because I'm a local and am so familiar with Sky Harbor, but the most important reason I like it is the speed and efficiency with which I can (a) drive in, pick up a passenger, and drive out, and (b) get off a plane, pick up my baggage, and step outside to the curb to be picked up. (Most likely by one friend in particular who is incapable of showing up on time, so that screws it all up, but that's not Sky Harbor's fault.

Pulling in, I decided to do lunch instead of dinner because I figured it would be a lighter crowd, and to some degree it was. I mean, it wasn't packed, thank goodness, but people were coming in like crazy!  Quite impressive at the heavy flow of traffic for a Saturday lunch hour.

I came in and asked the girl at the front how it works here.  She went through how I stand in line, and place my order at the counter and they make the food while I order.  There's also a HUGE selection of cold beer as you walk through line that's on ice, along with a great selection of cold side items to go with whatever you eat.

I took my time ordering at the register, and felt really comfortable taking my time.  No rush or pressure to ""hurry up"" and I had a lot of questions about their menu.  They had 3 different types of brisket, and I asked what the difference was between all three.  The girl told me that one was lean, one was not, and I forget what the third one was.  You can go with a half pounder type meal, or a smaller sandwich which is what I had wanted.  I went with the Moist Brisket, creamed corn, and a medium drink.  Total bill was just 9 and change.

I got my food and went to take a seat. Everything here is picnic table style, so your going to end up sitting next to strangers, which I'm fine with.  They have BBQ sauce, hot sauce and one or two other items at each end of the picnic tables. If your stuck in the middle, I don't know how you would get the BBQ sauce if its clear at the other end.  The Brisket itself was AWESOME! Most, tender and definitely awesome! I totally loved how it tasted, and everything was just right.

They also have a HUGE hand washing station for when your done eating.  Why do I love this?  First, BBQ is messy! You get your hands kinda gross from the sauce and who wants to go into the bathroom just to wash your hands? They have 4 or 5 different nozzles and the water is nice and warm..soap and towels to! right there out in the open!  I love it.

Here's why I deducted a star. It's going to sound SO DUMB but I think you'll get it. First, there wasn't really any BBQ sauce on the sandwich itself. That's fine because the meat tasted perfect without it.   Normally, at other BBQ places, there's a selection of a few different sauces to choose from if you want to dress your meat with sauce. Rudy's only had 2.  Regular and spicy.  Okay, I'll take that. 

Here's the catch. The sauce is IMPOSSIBLE to get out of the container! They have this weird nozzle on the sauce container and you must use both hands to get it out...including pounding on the bottom of the bottle and turning it 100% bottoms up!  I know what your thinking...the bottle must be empty, right? NO ITS 100% FULL.  I got so irritated with it, that I just stopped putting sauce on! I want more sauce! Why does it have to be a major project?   Eveyrtime I tried to sauce my sandwich, it became a huge bottle beating project!  Basically, they need better nozzles that let more sauce out so I don't have to break the dam thing to put it on my sandwich! argh!!!!!

Overall, I would 100% recommend this place! GO EAT HERE.  Definitely worth the drive!  They even have a little store in the front where you can buy stuff like BBQ sauce and other stuff for your home too!",review,IWwt0vm8lYbVoyGSPd2Z9A

- - - 

Beauty Rule #356: You can't go to a wedding in girly sling-backs without ensuring your feet at gorgeously taken care of. It's just all wrong if you do. 

Knowing this, I stopped by Q Nails last night 'round 5:30 to get my peds done. After all, I have a wedding to attend this weeked! 

I was immediately greeted when I walked through the door. ""I was hoping to get a pedicure,"" I said politely. ""Can you wait 5 mins? Pick out color!"" I looked over to my left and saw an array of nail polish. I nodded and sat down. 

After about a 8-10 minute wait (waiting always feels long when you have nothing to look at. All the mags were by the pedicure chairs), I was shown to the chair in the very back of the room. Another lady - who arrived shortly after me - was shown to the seat next to me. Her feet soaked for about 10 minutes while the young man who greeted me finished up another pedicure. Ironically, this same women finished her pedi before me and left about 20 minutes before I did. 

Immediately I switched the chair vibration/massage on. Mmmm. Talk about exactly what I needed. My feet soaked and I looked around. 6:4 - that was the ratio I saw after a while. 6 customers: 4 workers. Not too bad, I thought. The people giving the manis and pedis were attentive and worked quickly. 

Lucky me, I got a woman who took her time, who massaged lotion into my calves and feet for a solid 10 minutes. I did notice that only the women employees asked their customers what kind of lotion they wanted, since each little pedi station offered 3. I went with Jasmine. 

I also noticed that the young man who welcomed me into the store performed one of the fasted and most bizarre pedis I've ever seen. I thought for sure he was going to scrub the skin off with the pumice stone. Even the lady working on me was giving him a quizzical look. Oh well, he wasn't my guy... until my lady and him decided to do a swap. She got up to help a new customer while he finished ""perfecting"" my french tips. That's okay, I guess. 

Over all, I liked my experience. The interior is quite bare. There's a big golden Buddha welcoming you at the reception desk. There's soft ""Asian"" music playing overhead, which I found to be delightful and soothing. Sure beats pop music or a TV blaring. (They had their TV off.) 

Some notes I took while there:
*They offer ear piercing
*They offer facial and body waxing
*They soap their ped chairs after use, rinse and then do nothing more to sanitize (must be some strong soap, eh?)
*They don't throw away their pumice scrubs
*They DO make you sit at this front desk-thingy with the blue lights (I'm no expert to know what it's called) so that you're nails dry faster - both manis and pedis; i had to walk across the room barefoot, tho!
*They open at 9:30 a.m. and close at 7 p.m. and only work on Sundays by appointment
*They CAN NOT accept tips with credit, so bring your cash! 

I walked out feeling like a piece of sh*t because I didn't have any cash on me, nor did I know it was a the only way I could tip. I just assumed, like other places, I could write my tip on my receipt. WRONG. 

The price was reasonable. $25 for a french pedicure; $20 for a regular (i think - that's what their sign said). 

I think they could do a better job at sanitizing their tools. Only one girl giving a ped wore gloves. The rest used their bare hands. I'm not sure what the standard practice is, though.

Wanted to try this place back in March when Mom and I spotted an ad mentioning Filipino food in the plaza, but we'd already eaten pho, so had to wait until the next shopping opportunity brought us to this area again.  Met the very warm and friendly owners-- we really do wish them great success!

Since it was almost closing time, the food items in the buffet, and there weren't many to choose from, didn't look interesting, so we decided to try the pork skewers (the recipe of which the husband and wife team were very proud of), as well as the liempo (pork belly) serving that called out to Mom.  A combo plate of these two items also came with rice and achara (pickled papaya and carrots).  I also ordered one piece of saba at langka [saba bananas (or in this case, plantains) and jackfruit, wrapped in lumpia wrapper and deep-fried].

The wait for our food took longer than I expected, but it wasn't too much of an issue since Mom took awhile to do the groceries.  The wait, however, was worth it!  I really enjoyed the pork barbecue skewers- the flavors really took me back to my childhood in the Philippines, when street food, already a daily ritual for us then (and just now gaining popularity stateside) had us sampling BBQ, fried fishballs (and the many different sauces to dip them in!), steamed rolled rice and tuber pancakes, ripe and sour mangoes (the latter eaten with bagoong (very tiny salted shrimp) or vinegar and garlic, and ""dirty"" ice cream, to name a few from food carts that were to be seen all over Metro Manila and around colleges (grammar schools) and universities (""colleges"" here).  Writing about those pork skewers actually make me want to stop at Mekong Plaza now, instead of going for Italian or French food I was considering earlier!  The liempo, on the other hand, I could've gone without; I remember thinking that we should've just ordered a double of the BBQ!  The skewers were just more flavorful than the pork belly pieces.  While Mom enjoyed the liempo, she did agree that the BBQ was were the money was at, and the owners really did have something to be proud of!

Let's not forget the dessert!  On second thought, maybe we should.  First, I didn't care for the presentation.  Take a gander at the photos, and you'll see what I mean.  Second, it wasn't very sweet.  Not even sweet enough.  See that pool of caramel sauce the turon rested on?  I did not leave a single drop on the plate!  Not because it was so delicious, but because the roll really needed the added punch.  Mom already knew it wasn't going to be anything to write home about, just by looking at the offering, but did wait till I took a couple of bites before saying ""I should've just bought the ingredients at Mekong and made you those at home!""  My sentiments exactly, Mommy dearest!

Speaking strictly as an eastsider, I can't image ever coming all the way out to this place for any reason other than an event at the arena or stadium.

The parking situation is an absolute mess if there is an event going on. Somebody please build another access road or two to the Loop 101! 

While I like most of the bars and restaurants in Westgate, there's nothing special about them. It's mostly chains that you can find elsewhere in the valley. Some of the shops are unique, but not unique enough to justify a ride out west. Westgate is too big for the hockey crowd, but too small to support the football crowd. Good luck getting into any of the bars before or after a Cardinals game. If you're one of the few who went to see the Coyotes play, the place is all yours after the game is over.

Meat. Cheese. Potatoes. In bread. Oh and Banoffee pie.

Unabridged:
This is my favorite Pasty location. First off, there is tons of space. Tons. The decor also has a nice relaxing but slightly sophisticated feel. And there aren't a million ASU students prancing about and hardly ever a wait in line when we head there for lunch. 

Vegetarian or not, there's always a pasty for everyone. Every time I've gone to either location, I've never gotten the same one twice, and I still have over 3/4 of the menu to clear off my list with most of them being ones I would love to enjoy. They're big enough that half the time I end up taking half home with me... though that's probably because I after trying the Banoffee Pie, I haven't been able to not order it since. So usually it's take half my pasty home and split Banoffee, which is the most heavenly dessert on the planet. 

All the items are made there, and if you sit at the bar/kitchen area you can watch them making them right there in the restaurant. It's kinda fun really. Sometimes I watch a little too closely if I know they're making a favorite, trying to figure out how I can mimic this masterpiece at home. Alas, I've always ended up failing. 

One thing to note is that while they make them there, they prep them in advance so you cannot substitute. However, I've been toying with the idea of calling a week in advance to have a special one made and paying up front so I can enjoy it a few days later.

So, back to this Banoffee Pie deal... I think I need to inform you in advance to save you from desperately trying to resist its allure when you visit due to this amazingly good review. So, it's a pretty awesome dessert. First, you start with a thick graham cracker crust. I am personally not a huge fan of graham cracker, but this isn't your typical crust like on a pie or a lemon bar. This looks like texas toast. For serious. Then add some homemade caramel, homemade whipped cream and bananas. This only adds up to a win.",review,vARjqeIkSNsazHltujiq4Q

I've lived downtown for about 4 years now and had never been until last night. We went in to watch the Suns game and once the game started the place cleared out and we had it to ourselves. I was actually surprised it is a pretty nice place, and definitely expected more of a low key atmosphere like Majerle's, but it is pretty fancy. 

They have two bars, which give a distinctly different vibe. The indoor bar feels very club like, while the outdoor bar feels a little more neighborhoody and casual. The outdoor bar is a great place to watch sports on TV. The servers and bartenders I encountered were definitely nice people and very accommodating. I gotta lose 15 lbs so I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and thought it was very good, and a decent size to make a meal for a guy. Their chefs BTW, for the entire Bill Smith empire, a restaurant Stoudemire's is a part of, are Michael Cairns and Matt Alleshouse, who came from the Arizona Biltmore as Executive Chef and Wright's Chef de Cuisine respectively. That would probably account for the ever improving food. 

I probably won't be screaming to return to the place though for a couple of reasons. One; the cost. Salad and 3 gin and tonics = $48!!!  Like I said, it was a great salad, but woo for them for being able to get such a great profit margin. Reason two is there is nothing to really set this place apart from other sports bars in the area that offer more unique settings like Majerle's, Alice Cooperstown, or even Friday's for that matter.

The location is great - I love this little hub near Turf and Sens (and, conveniently, my good friend's apartment). It takes up the bottom floor of what appears to be residential in the upper floors? I might be wrong, but it's a nice use of space. No lot, so parking is kind of lame now that you gotta pump coins into the meters until 8p. But I just turned south on 3rd St. and parked a little ways down the road for free- no big deal.

The service was also great. Our server was friendly, comfortable and on his game. Coming by often (but without hovering or seeming pesky) to clear plates, get more drink orders, refill waters and get orders for party members who trickled in, in ones and twos. He had opinions on the food and drinks and was pretty helpful. At hh, they were plenty of rolls for around $5-$7.

The food was OK. I'm not a sushi person, so it appeared about the same as anything I've seen or tasted from Ra, to be honest. But others at the table had criticisms about what was possibly imitation crab in the Vegas Roll, and other shrug-able bites. Oh, I was intrigued by their edamame shui mai, crispy little balls filled with white fish and soy beans and that come out skewered on stick, and well presented/arranged in bowl. Simple enough to grab a stick and pass the bowl along to share. Cool and unique

Drinks - we were here on hh and I didn't even crack the regular menu, but decent hh specials for the atmosphere and cool-factor. I had an Asahi bomber for $7 and a specialty drink, the Sun Kiss for $6. There were also wine and beer options on the hh menu, but it was select list a drinks, not a catch-all $1 or $2 off deal. 

The space is modern chic ... and a bit like every other new cool restaurant in that way. But I like the long sushi bar and about 10 other tables for parties of two and up to six. Lots of picture windows that look out on the street and would be a good spot to perch on First Friday. Bathrooms are well done (I love swanky bathrooms!).

1. Well, the clothes, of course. For example, I was desperate for a new, cute dress for a night out at the museum a few weeks ago, and scoured my brain for options in Tempe: Urban Outfitters - their clothes are simply not well-made or quality enough for the price and rarely fit anyone nicely; Buffalo - yeah, if I'm in the mood for a hunt and peck shopping day where one out of 30 items is worth trying on; Sunset - better than Buffalo but no guarantees. Not only is Loveland on par with Frances and Bunky, two of my downtown faves, they have a bigger, more varying selection: if you loved Zoey Deshanel's wardrobe in 500 Days, there are skirts and blouses right up your alley here; there are also basic summer maxis, structured vintage-style dresses a la mad men, cute, comfy t-shirts, pretty coats,  happy hour appropriate blouses, lounge pants, denim (not a ton, but a bit), fancy party dresses and more. Finally, Tempe got that much cooler. 


2. The owners, one of which I met on my first trip in, because they have excellent taste in music (listening to Lykke Li and The Blow instead of Pink makes all the difference during a hot, stuffy, marathon of trying clothes on) and because just one of their buying philosophies is ""every dress should have pockets."" Hallelujah!


3. Kids' stuff. My BFF just found out her little eggo is preggo, and now I actually peruse this kind of stuff and was delighted with my finds here. What I thought were cute totes that I would actually buy were mini stroller bags. They also had an adorable girl's dress in the cutest 70s pattern and style that, if it were larger, I would wear myself. And the boy's ensembles were cute without being predictable, and all the clothes were soft, soft, soft. I made many, many mental notes for upcoming baby-related events.

4. Jewelry. Unique and either edgy, or pretty, or just fun, for reasonable prices.

5. It's location. Tempe desperately needs more sophisticated bars, restaurants and shopping that appeals to young(ish), urbanites and hip professionals - not just college-age hipsters. Loveland is one of few such options, and I want to shout from a mountain top how important it is to support it!",review,k-x29qcFyaRmEIDfPpef0Q

There's a reason Butterfield's has a two hour wait on the weekends. It's because this isn't your average breakfast. They don't just have basic omelets and pancakes on the menu. No, they have succulent skillets filled with cheese, hashbrowns, eggs and toppings galore. They have buttermilk pancakes with different flavors such as Oreo cookie pancakes. They have bacon Belgian waffles. They have oven baked pancakes! The menu is large and in charge and this breakfast definitely leaves you full for the rest of the day! 

During my first official visit here, I ate my heart out. I ordered the Santa Fe Scrambler which comes with eggs (I opted for egg whites), Chorizo sausage, red jalapeño pepper, onion & cheddar cheese. All this sits atop freshly made crispy hashbrowns. As if that's not enough, the scrambler comes with your choice of pancakes or toast. Of course I ordered the homemade buttermilk pancakes! The feast arrived relatively quickly and it was absolutely a feast! There was no way I could finish the meal, but every bite I took was better then the next. The hashbrowns were the perfect amount of crispy and the Chorizo had a nice kick to it. The avocado and peppers blended in quite nicely and there was plenty of cheese to go around!

Inside was boisterous: downtown lunch crowd with every table occupied and several other folks hovering over the tables waiting to jump at any sign of an open seat.  It's kind of funny that this place, given its funky and crunchy ambiance, is located so close to downtown Phoenix and packed with suits, when I would have pegged it as some joint you'd find on 4th Ave in Tucson full of college kids. There are salads and rice bowls offered, as well as smoothies like Bluenanarama and Marion Berry, but the big star on the menu, naturally, is the selection of wraps: 16, in fact, plus one daily special on the chalkboard. Some other wraps that Stevey hasn't mentioned in his review include the Gringo Star, The Veggie Jackson, The Prince of Thai's, and the Cheech & Dijon Chicken. Can't fault them for trying to be creative. Each wrap goes for $6.95 a pop, plus a side of pasta or fruit salad or chips & salsa. Kind of steep for a wrap, probably, but the quality of the ingredients is fresh and they don't OD with useless unhealthy stuff if they don't need to. 

I myself chose the Ken & Barbie-Que Chicken wrap, and got it to go since I didn't think any table was going to clear up soon. The wait was fairly long, though, about 20-25 minutes, and in that time I glanced about signs thanking patrons for coming to independent businesses like this one (That's A Wrap is part of Phoenix's Chain Reaction coalition). Once I got my order and had a chance to eat it, I was pretty well satisfied, because hot damn - this was one pretty damn tasty wrap! So right on, I'd say.

I'll definitely be back - just probably not during weekday lunch hour, though.  I'd say anytime after 1 (they're open til 5 on weekdays) or on a Saturday (10:30 - 3:00) is a safer bet if you want to check it out. If you do go on weekday lunchtime, go with at most one other person to give yourselves a good shot of getting a table. Or call your order in and get it to go.

Met with a few friends who'd already started drinking during happy hour (read 530p) and finished dinner before I arrived around 840p.  Serendipitously found a great parking spot across the front entrance.  I knew I wouldn't enjoy my stay here when I was hit by such loud chattering as soon as I opened the front door.  That and the scent of rancid beer that greeted me were enough to make me want to bolt, but I'd already let my friends know I'd arrived via text and Yelp check-in.  Found my friends at a four-top, sat down, and proceeded to shout hellos- strike three!  I REALLY dislike having to shout to a person who's sitting/standing right beside me to be heard.  What's even worse is having to nuzzle my ear to their mouth to understand what they're saying...  Really made me wish I was at mellow Four Peaks, already sipping on a cold pint of Peach ale and waiting on dinner to arrive.

I sat at that table for twenty minutes watching at least three different servers pass by without stopping to ask if I needed anything.  Thank goodness I brought my bottle of water with me, or I would've been really annoyed, because not only were my head and ears aching from the noise, but I was also hungry AND very thirsty, as well!  It was only around the 30-minute mark, while I and two other friends were standing by a landing of stairs did a server stop and ask if I had been helped.  By that time, I'd already made up my mind to leave and was already saying goodbye to my friends.

Too bad I couldn't get any love... 3 oz beer samplers are $1 or $2 (those designated with a plus sign).  Would've been a fun way to taste my way through the menu while checking out just how well the servers know the beers they offer- I'm a newbie to the world of beers, but I already know I don't like a lot of hops.

Pints are $5 each (boo!), but $9 per pitcher (awesome!), and that's not even happy hour prices!  A pint of local brewery Four Peaks is $5- what?  I expected to see a lot of O.H.S.O. brewery beers, but I only spotted TWO.  But I shouldn't have even bothered to study all of this since I never received service!",review,wNsmt1hF1uv3YvbwXZMAoQ

I eagerly waiting on pins and  needles for this.  See, after I moved out here, I got hooked on the Rapid shuttle bus system.  It was glorious!  I was able to get to work in less time (and gas money) then if I were to have driven.  The same rule applies to the light rail.  Its a much easier commute for me versus driving. 

But, sometimes  I wonder what other people really expect the light rail to do for them.  I wanted to list the pros and cons of the light rail so people can adaquately adjust thier expectations and understand what they are getting into.

Pros:

A) The cost of the light rail is relatively cheap.  $2.50 a day, or $45 a month, you are getting a rock solid deal.  Think about how much gas you use in your car.  I doubt its less then what light rail charges.

B) The light rail is clean!  I have yet to see a dirty train!  Well air conditioned as well.

C)  The train is not going to be faster then your car speedwise.  I've seen a few reviews where people have said that they could have driven faster then the train.  Well, duh!  Your car is going to be faster then the train.  It makes frequent stops, and doesnt go as fast as your car does.  Please plan accordingly.  You will need to leave earlier due to waiting for the train, riding and walking to your destination.

D) If you see something wacko on the train, call 911.  Or valley metro.   seriously.

Cons: 

I can't think of any at the moment.

Anyways, point is, I ride it to work twice a day M-F.  It saves me gas money, and mostly a very expensive parking bill for working downtown.  Please, ride the light rail, and enjoy!",review,bts6jVczHJuWzpT8Y26UsQ

Or maybe it was because the couple of other Jamaican places I have been to have been dives?  I loved the classy intimacy of this restaurant.  It gave me the feeling that I was having dinner at someone's house who was both a great cook and also had great taste in decor.

The impression I have of Jamaican food is that it has really strong flavors but I found the food here to be a little bland.  I got the jerk shrimp which didn't look very blackened or like it even had a rub on it.  However, when I tasted it I was surprised and pleased that there was actually a good spicy kick to it.  This was by far the best part of my meal.  The sides it came with tasted good but were nothing special.  I did really love their cocktails but I wrote another review of the bar since that is a separate business listing.  I like the fact that there was so much seafood on the menu (try the mussels, they are yummy) but I think someone who is more of a meat eater might be disappointed.  I was also surprised there was no goat on the menu - don't Jamaican places usually have goat?

I was hoping the Mill Ave location would be a step up from the Biltmore just by sheer fact that there are students. Students throng to coffee shops. Therefore it should be hopping, open late, and prices decent. 

Well, this locale is kind of sort of hopping, but most folks come for the gelato. The coffee itself is mediocre. Actually less than mediocre. My iced decaf with tax was $3.37 or something. That's right. Not a latte. Not a mocha. Not some blended drink worth 500 calories. Just plain decaf coffee over ice. Something is ridiculously off with their pricing. 

They're also open til midnight only on Fridays and Saturdays, the rest of the week only til 10. Eh? With ASU right there you'd think that these guys would be open late every night.

Total trip time was 1 hour 10 minutes. Granted it only takes me about half that time to drive, but taking the Metro just makes you feel good. That and you can people watch, read a book whatever.

So I was surprised when I found out that there isn't anyone named Giuseppe working in the back, though this wasn't the only surprise of the evening. The other little curve ball was a little embarrassing, we were scrambling to scrape together enough money to pay the bill, Ristorante Giuseppe only takes cash. However, this little stumble did not interfere with the food nor the fantastic service and hospitality we received. 

Ristorante Giuseppe is what a mom and pop independent restaurant is all about. The charismatic father runs the front of the house, the sons are the servers and mom makes all of the desserts. The father Pasquale interacts with everyone, he's so warm and welcoming it was like going to a friends home for dinner. While they do not serve liquor, you're more than welcome to bring your own beer and wine to accompany your dinner and no corkage fee, unbelievable. 

The menu is filled with classic Italian-American dishes and as well as assorted daily specials. Our server was telling us about the specials and noticed that his eyes were steel blue. I'm not sure how long he was talking to us but as soon as he walked away my trance was broken; I have no idea what he said. I can be such a dork.

Once you place your order you're brought out a basket of warm bread with garlic butter, I love little touches like this. Just be careful not to fill up on the fluffy bread, there's so much in store starting with the deliciously simple Eggplant Rollatini ($9.75). Slices of eggplant are lined with cheese, covered in bread crumbs and pan fried, then the roll ups are covered with tomato sauce and cheese. Or if you loved stewed peppers and onions try the Peperonata ($6.95), a great combination of sweet, savory with just a hint of spice. 

My dining companions filled me in on the nightly specials which ended up being a couple of pasta dishes. The first was the Peppino Special ($15.95), a mix of tube pasta, alfredo and tomato sauces with meatballs, chicken and sausage then covered with cheese and baked. Another was the big brother to the tortellini called Tortelloni ($15.95), a large ring shaped pasta, filled with meat then again covered in sauce, cheese and baked. Do you see the trend here? Baked pasta dishes are so hearty and satisfying; no wonder the other patrons looked so happy. 

Along side we also had Sausages ($1.95) and Meatballs ($1.95) which were platted as a clever homage to the maleness of the restaurant, with just a little bit of cream sauce on the tip of each sausage, well you get the idea. 

Desserts were as comforting and homey like the creamy smooth Cheesecake ($3.95) which ended up being one of the best slices of cheesecake I've had in a very long time. Not being a fan of Cannoli ($3.95) Id have to say that they turned me into a believer. Its ricotta filling was so light and airy with just the right amount of chocolate chips and a pastry shell that was crisp without a trace of greasiness.

Even better than that? It's all thanks to you guys.

I started last Saturday wasting the first half of a great day outside trying to get my cell phone, which seemed to be dialing Mars on its own, fixed. The phone people near my place couldn't do anything, and sent me off to the PV Mall area to get it looked there instead. Long story short, many hours later, I ended up buying a new phone, and I hadn't eaten and drunk anything all day. Me in a starving and dehydrated state is not a great sight to behold.

It was almost 5 by the time my phone ordeal was all over, and I was going to head home to take a nap, but then I remembered seeing glowing Yelp reviews about some Japanese place nearby. However, I forgot the name and where it was located. But then I realized my new phone had web browsing, and after a few minutes of searching, Yelp led me to Yasu. Score!

Yasu is completely unassuming from the outside. I mean, it's in a strip mall a few doors down from a 7-Eleven and around the corner from Target. I walked in just as the doors opened at 5, with a quick sushi dinner all I was expecting to have.

I felt I was a little under dressed in my disheveled post-cell phone marathon state, but I decided to sit up at the corner bar where I got to know Ryan, the manager, and Yasu, the eponymous head chef. They're great folks - apparently Yasu the restaurant has become a local legend in the short time it's been open and reservations are strongly recommended - but these two didn't make me, Mr. Delirious In His Birkenstocks, feel any less of a patron. Even after I only ordered some rolls, nigiri and sashimi while completely disregarding the daily ""Specials From The Kitchen"" menu. 

It was around this time that a couple sat up at the bar with me. They knew Ryan. They knew Yasu. I could tell that these two were regulars and they always sat up at the bar. Really friendly from the get-go, they ordered a great bottle of Sicilian wine and sent a glass my way (I already was doing well on a bottle of sake that Yasu recommended).

What did they order? They left it all up to Ryan to decide on everything. And of course that means things from the Specials from the Kitchen menu. I felt lame sitting there eating my sushi. Don't get me wrong. The quality of the fish was excellent. Much of it imported straight from Japan. Presented well and tasting better than any sushi I've had in Phoenix yet. But I soon realized that it wasn't why these two bar compatriots of mine came here.

Out came the mackerel tempura. My barmates were both full of compliments. 

15 minutes later, out came the scallop carpaccio. This dish looked amazing, and again, talked about in nothing but superlatives.

I was really enjoying hanging out at the bar - watching what Ryan had Yasu concoct in the kitchen for his regulars - so much so that I didn't realize that the entire restaurant had filled out behind my back. The place was hopping! 

By now, I'm engrossed in conversation with Ryan and the regulars (while watching the Sox make Scooby Snacks out of the Indians)....

Out comes a bowl of clams in garlic miso sauce.

My new friends each try one. 

""Hot damn!"" says one. 

""Oh wow. Oh WOW. Wow wow wow wow wow. Hey, give me your plate. You HAVE to try this,"" says the other.

Me? Sure! 

WOW. and HOT DAMN.

That clam was incredible. 

And that sauce was like serious crack. 

Ryan: ""Don't you think once you're done with the clams, the sauce would be great soaked up in rice or sopped up with some French bread?""

This guy is GOOD. And out comes a bowl of rice.

Followed by 100% Kobe medium rare sirloin with two dipping sauces.

Then comes some cobia (black king fish) pate.

Then comes the uni (sea urchin) with avocado.

Then comes the foie gras on marinated eggplant. 

Each time something came, each time I partook. And each time I was more than impressed. How impressed? I've been eating sushi for eons, but I never thought I'd ever try uni. But I did this evening. And I really enjoyed it. Presentation on each and every dish was a work of art.

And each time my small cup of sake neared its end, Ryan, who had my bottle chilling on ice, would fill it back up again and put my bottle back to chill. And after it was done, I ordered a glass of that Sicilian red, because why not.

With my back to the restaurant, I was in my own world with the two regulars and the manager. Enough so that all of a sudden it was 10. 

10.

I sat at a sushi bar for FIVE HOURS. Here I was, thinking I was just going to walk into some place next to Target to eat some quick sushi after ending up with a new phone.

And without Yelp, this wouldn't have happened. 

So Megan, Jason, Nadia, MJ, Shannon, Adrian and Jim:

Thank You.

Maybe my phone was meant to die after all.

The service was pretty slow-moving and we soon learned that this is probably not the best spot to stop by if you're on a time limit. The food itself is decent, but the selections to choose from on the menu are pretty random. I couldn't quite pin point the type of cuisine this restaurant would be categorized as, but it's a hefty selection of Mediterranean eats such as prosciutto, cheeses, paninis and pizzas. The pizzas are only around $11 and they are easily able to be shared. The salads are also pretty large in size and could easily be shared as well. 

In summary, this is a good spot to have a couple after-work cocktails and maybe stay for an appetizer or two, but I'll probably keep Hanny's at just that for me and choose another location for my meal, especially if I have to be somewhere!

The hard drive went out on it, and after trying to get it fixed by a friend, I finally accepted that it was toast.  I wasn't really prepared for this to happen, as I had anticipated it lasting another year before replacing it.  But, such is life, and I guess it was time for the computer to go.

Mind you, I've never made a major purchase from Fry's electronics. I've been here in the past  for smaller purchases, but nothing more then here and there. Being that I was in the market again for a computer, and since things have changed since I last purchased a computer several years ago, I needed to refresh myself with what was out there.  (not just computer wise, but even the retail landscape has changed dramatically as well.)

I did some shopping around at Costco, Best Buy, and after a friend accompanied me here, I decided that Fry's had the selection and price that I was looking for.  I came in for my purchase on Wednesday night, because their New Years sale was ending. I was down to two computers that I had my eye on, and figured it was time to purchase before the sale ended.

The guy who helped me was awesome.  Total tech guy who totally new his stuff.  I was impressed with his knowledge. I showed him the two models that I wanted, and asked him which one would be better for me.  After explaining the differences, he said that either model will do me fine for a laptop, and that the $50 price difference was really up to me. He said that the cheaper model was the way to go, and that for $50 LESS I was not going to see a major speed difference for what I was getting.

He went back and grabbed the computer and had it at the register after I finished wandering the store.  He also told me that if I purchased Microsoft I could get it for $89 instead of the $120 that it would cost me if I waited until the 60 days ran out and they charge you. I said that I'm not a huge word user, and would pass.  

He was really educated and filled in a LOT of blanks for me that I couldn't have filled in myself.  I had a really positive experience here, and I feel like Fry's is the new Best Buy for me.  Plus, even though Costco has great prices, your on your own with buying and hoping its every thing you need. Plus, I've found that they rotate stock a lot at Costco and what you see today may not be there in a month. (trust me, I tried. The computer I had my eye on in early December there is not for sale through them anymore.  They rotated and put out an entirely different stock when I went back to purchase around New Years.

Even tho Costco seems to have a better warranty and tech support offer on their computers then Fry's, their stock rotates to fast and if you don't buy it within a short window of time, you may not get the make and model that you want.

The decor is simple but appropriate, the seating is comfortable, with both booths & tables available (Yeah booths!), plus picnic benches outside on the attached covered patio.

The prices here are LOW here for a BBQ restaurant, & for this first visit I ordered one of their Lunch Specials, which for me was their Moist Brisket with a Potato Salad side & a big cup of help-yourself lemonade.  Your sandwich meat is cut right off the roast to order, weighed, & served up on waterproof paper in a big plastic commercial soft drink carrier tray!  You get a couple of big waterproof placemats too, & slices of white bread.  (I had him give me two, but would ask for four next time, as there was enough meat to make two sandwiches.)

Over at the condiment area there are onions, dill pickle slices, & a Jalapeño & carrot relish to help yourself to.  Then you put everything together at your table add your choice of sauces, mustard & so on, to make a big, messy, great tasting sandwich (or two).

You can't find time in your day to hop on a plane to the United Kingdom? Well that's quite all right because I have the next best option right in our own desert backyard. I am talking about the one and the only royal experience at the English Rose Tea Room in none other than Cave Creek Arizona. 

I will just start by saying that the website and pictures don't do this little afternoon tea house any justice. Think of the English Rose Tea Room like the perfect haven for ladies who lunch. The ambiance is fit for a Queen. It's girly, it's cozy and it's adorable, almost like a magical elf's cottage. The woman who runs this tea room is English herself which makes the experience that much more enjoyable. As you walk in, a quaint outdoor patio greets you and once inside, shelves line the walls with every type of tea and tea accessory imaginable. Oh and let's not forget about the Queen herself welcoming you inside (or a cut-out, but we're playing imagination here). Behind the panels lies an intimate tea room where ladies and their guests lunch or have afternoon tea. Hats? Yes there are plenty of hats all around. Did you forget your hat? Well that's ok because there's a basket full ready to be loaned out for the occasion. 

Moving on to the tea experience itself, well it's really quite charming. The menu ranges from basic lunch items such as quiche, chicken salad sandwiches and salads to afternoon tea items where you can order the entire Afternoon Tea ($24.99 a person) or you can pick and choose from an a la carte menu. Because my Mom and I had waited so long to try the English Rose Tea Room and we went to celebrate her belated birthday, we ordered a feast fit for a Queen. We first started by sharing the half English salad split for two which was a perfectly fresh salad of greens, raspberries, candied pecans and a delicious raspberry vinaigrette. Following our salad, the Afternoon Tea for two appeared in front of our very eyes! This three-tier meal was accompanied by our choice of tea. We decided to go with the apricot and enjoyed every last sip of not one but two pots! The tea was so delicious you don't need sugar or cream either. The three-tier tea included 6 mini sandwiches a piece (2 cucumber, 2 chicken salad & 2 salmon), two very large (and scrumptious) scones topped w/ powdered sugar and many mini desserts to finish off the meal. My favorite items were the chicken salad tea sandwich, the salmon tea sandwich and the scone. The desserts were decent but the scone really stole the sweet-filled show. 

This is a truly delightful place to spend a lazy afternoon when you have nothing but time. Don't visit expecting to be in and out for a quick lunch. No, tea is meant to be savored and you can absolutely do that at this perfectly tealightful restaurant.",review,xVsxFJlEQ_L-LoJU1U8A-A

He was however helpful and knowledgeable with the menu. John had a burger that was meaty and juicy (like his first girlfriend in middle school back in Jersey he says), Monika had a chicken sandwich while I was daring and had a fish (I believe cat) sandwich. Mine was great, I would skip the cheese next time as it takes over the mildness of said fish. We enjoyed an app of sausage fondue....scarey good.

The first time, less than two years ago, I ordered the chicken shawarma entree (complete with pickled veggies, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita).  Many of the chicken pieces were still uncooked that I could hardly chew it, and some were still blood-red!  When I started to complain about about this to my server, he acted as if no one has ever complained about the food here before.  He left, and he came back with whom I thought was the cook, who had acted even more offended about my accusation of the meat being uncooked.  He mentioned something about how everything is timed perfectly in the oven, but he offered to bring a new dish out.  Twelve minutes later (yes, I time these things), a slightly more cooked dish of chicken was laid out in front of me.  I decided I'd salvage what I could and just chalk it up to a bad day.  My favorite things in that entree were the pickled veggies and the garlic sauce.  Oh my... the garlic sauce!!  

A few days after that, I brought my Mom with me for dinner.  We ordered the lamb kabob entree to share.  She wasn't impressed with the kabobs, since she had Byblos' lamb shanks on the brain (Byblos' lamb is pretty good, we think).  It was official- the hummus here leaves much to be desired.  However, I still thought the garlic sauce was fantastic!  Tastes great with the tabouli/tabouleh (both are correct).

Fast-forward many, many months to two days ago, I decided to order take-out for Mom and me- chicken shawarma sandwich, no pickle (tomatoes, lettuce, and garlic sauce in pita); gyro, no pickle, no cucumber sauce (lamb meat and lettuce in pita); and gyro with everything for Mom.  Why did it take me all this time to finally order these sandwiches to-go?  Both types are must-tries: the shawarma is a popular choice of many here, and all it takes is one bite for you to know why.  The sauce and garlic schmear combo is to-die-for!  And one would think that a pita with only lamb meat and lettuce sounds too simple to be so tasty, but it is!  The meat is so moist and tender, you really don't need any condiment.  Trust me.  Heck, don't trust me and order one plain and one with the works and judge them yourself; Most of the sandwiches costs less than $4 each!  

BTW, you may elect to have whole wheat pita instead of the plain normally used.  You may also take Haji-Baba pitas home (made at the Haji-Baba bakery on Apache east of the restaurant); you may find them on the register counter.  

You may pay for your take-out in advance and then wait for it to be prepared, or you may want to check out the grocery aisles as you're waiting and pay for everything at the end.  I suggest the chocoholics check out the Swiss chocolate bars here!  I've tried a few brands, and I just love the Milka brand: milk chocolate with whole hazelnut, milk and creamy white layered, plain milk chocolate.  (I love dark chocolate, but couldn't find one allergen-free.)  The flavors are so creamy and you can definitely taste the great quality ingredients used.  There are cheaper brands sold here, but a not-so-quick glance (you may or may not find English among the five or so languages listed on the back) will reveal that other vegetable fat, not cocoa butter, is used.  Go for the ""good chocolate"" brands; At two dollars or less a bar, you can leave with a goodie cache without having to spend much cash.  

You'll most likely find something in the grocery you'll want to buy, so don't forget to remember to pick up your take-out order.

Being on a high from some kickass Lo-Lo's  waffle and chicken, I was thinking of heading to the Roosevelt for a few brews. Called up some friends, and they mentioned that Lost Leaf might be open for drinks now (I've only been there previously when they've been a gallery). They live closeby, and we thought we could at least check out Lost Leaf, and if they weren't serving any drinks, then the Roosevelt was a short hop away.

But we were in no need to hop, for we were in luck. Lost Leaf, the ""Bar"", was open for business.

They apparently had a ""soft openening"" the previous Friday and their big brouhaha grand opening is tomorrow (First Friday), but they were well and open tonight. Score!

It was kind of stange to see the place filled with tables and stools since I've been used to walking around there staring at art, but the ambiance was still cool, with Chadwick's art hanging from almost every wall. Tato was friendly and helpful and we picked a selection of wine, beer, and mojito-in-a-bottle at our discretion. Lost Leaf also serves He'brew Beer, which I've only seen on sale at Trader Joe's and never at a bar, so they get points just for that. If for the novelty factor.

But in any case, the ambiance is great with low lighting, alternative music, and brilliant art pieces, but I'm still going to avoid it on First Fridays since it's smack in the middle of everything and is definitely going to be insanely packed on those nights. But for other nights, this joint is definitely worth chilling at. 

Now it is a bar in all sense of the word (well, a bar/gallery, but anyway), which means no food on the menu, but it's still worth the trip over.

This thin crust is so crispy that it has a crunch similar to a cracker, especially the crust at the end of the slice.  Perfectly golden brown with a healthy amount of residual flour on the bottom makes this a memorable pizza that is very close to the thin crust examples I had in north Chicago many years ago.

Little Chicago is pretty much a take-out and delivery place, with just a handful of tables inside and on the pato sidewalk (maybe 4 tables total).

This bar treats its customers like they are college kids. I suppose they are somewhat justified in this since it is typically a younger crowd. I've had mixed experiences coming here... in the past, I've had acceptable and decent service here, but the last several times I've been there the service has gotten progressively worse. On the last occasion, they took forever to take my drink order and then poured me the wrong drink... then when I went to politely return the full glass of whatever and get what I ordered, they refused to re-make it. I left it on the bar and they threw it away (keeping my money of course) and gave me a dirty look. I also had aggressive bar backs shove me out of the way. 

That experience alone was enough for me to never go back, but it wasn't an isolated incident. It wasn't always that way though... The staff in general here all seem to be complete assholes, but I can almost recall a time when they were decent to me - back in the 1990s. It's a pity because this bar is in a great building and has a fun layout. It's breezy and open and conducive to having a good time drinking after work with your buddies. My old roommate used to hit this place often with his corporate pals and he loved the atmosphere. They do make their drinks pretty strong, so maybe he was too trashed to care about the bad service. 

In their defense, their patrons are often rowdy, young, and unruly - so that's probably why it has evolved into this. I've found the Tempe location to be more laid back though, so it's still pretty excessive if you ask me. I have to give this place an extra star because it's still a good place for young folks to go grab a beer and chill.

My first, and (so far) only, visit to Fleming's.  I give it 2.5 stars...

First thing I noticed was that it was very dark inside- a pet peeve of mine.  Second, the service looked either harried or aloof.  Where were the smiling faces?  It was 4:15 pm, which meant the doors had just opened 15 minutes ago, and there weren't many guests yet waiting to be seated.  (There were about eight people at the bar area.)  I soon met my server, whose cold gaze and unsmiling face already had me thinking maybe this place was not such a good idea.  

After studying the menu, I decided I'd try the Prime Burger for $6. I also asked if I could sample a couple of red wines before ordering a glass of one.  I've been to many venues where this is not a problem, and sometimes, when I can't decide, even willingly offered!  This Fleming's location isn't one of these venues.  My query brought about a more negative change of attitude from my server, but I did get to try two very small samples before choosing a glass.

While I waited for the burger to arrive, I began to boot up my laptop- thank goodness I brought it, bec. the burger took a long time...  The bar area was filling up fast, and the servers started to look even more agitated that I was starting to wonder what was all the fuss?  Finally, just under 20 minutes later, my beautiful burger arrived.  Huge patty, smothered w/ cheese and topped w/ thick-cut, peppered, and smoked bacon, tomato, onion, lettuce, and a pretzel bun.  The one huge onion ring was a nice touch.  The burger was juicy (cooked to my specified medium), quite substantial, and delicious w/ the cheddar, veggies, and bun.  The thick-cut bacon, however, was so salty, that I had to take the slices off!  I was a bit disappointed, since it was such a hearty portion of bacon.

I wouldn't mind having another Prime burger, minus the bacon, for happy hour again, but I'd choose another location. 

BTW, as I was enjoying the burger, I finally figured out why all the harried faces and the servers' hustle and bustle-- it seemed like everyone in the bar area had chosen the burger!  The table of six in front of me all had burgers... At $6, it's a steal for diners, but perhaps not expensive enough to garner a nice tip?

I checked the website for directions, and found that they were wonderfully accurate.  Central was under construction, so the website told me how to get to the restaurant despite light rail construction.  Very convienient.

I wandered in and was promptly greeted by a nice gentleman. I told him I was dining alone, and he escorted me to the bar area. I have to say, the Fez is well decorated.  I don't know what to call the decor, but its very modern and clean.  I noticed they have cool glass looking things hanging from the ceiling to look like walls to break up the bar area from the rest of the resturant.  Theres also a bunch of light bulbs hanging off to one area, which I thought was cool to look at.  Very hip interior.

While reviewing the menu, I wasn't sure what to get.  They had a great selection of food and drinks, but I wanted to keep it simple since it was my first time here.  I spoke with the waiter who was wonderfully attentive, and asked a few questions.  

I finally decided on the American Burger, and boy, was I glad that did!  WOW.  I was blown away.  This burger was amazing!  It was cibolta bread, and had a tasty cheese on the meat itself.  I also believe that the mustard had a little kick to it....but not an overly powerful kick.  It actually complimented the burger!  This was the right balance of taste, texture and flavor that I needed.  This is how burgers SHOULD be made.

Upon entering, we were confused because we couldn't see a check in area.  Eventually, the hostess came by, gave us a dirty look, and said tersely ""You didn't enter the right way.  This is the back way"".  We were shown to a table after she bitchily asked us how many people we wanted a table for, but I was miffed that she was so annoyed at the fact we accidentally went in through the wrong entrance.  Looking at the sign when we left, there wasn't any indication that it was the back entrance, nor were there any instructions to enter through the front.  How were we supposed to know it wasn't the right way to enter?  Maybe they should put up a sign or some indication that this isn't the correct entrance (or lock the back door), wouldn't that clarify things a bit? (Or maybe the hostess shouldn't be so bitchy to customers?  Just a thought.)

Despite being treated rudely by the hostess, our server was very friendly.  The red velvet pancakes were moist, chocolatey, and covered with a mild tasting mascarpone cheese.  The Gran Marnier sauce was delicious, and I could definitely taste the liquor in it!  I tried some of the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes, which were also very good.

There was the bumper boat that my niece couldn't go on bec. she was too tall, and this was the only downside to whole experience- it was clear that my nephew enjoyed it.  However, there were other rides for the older girl to try, that it didn't take long to quell the tears.  Even though most of the rides were geared toward toddlers, my niece and nephew really enjoyed themselves and kept talking about how much fun they had for a few days after!  My sister and I loved seeing their enjoyment.  We also liked the fact that the amusement park is IN an actual park, and a quite charming one, at that.  I was a little wary after reading a couple of online reviews stating how rundown it was, but the park wasn't as shabby as I was led to believe.  

I again thank about.com for revealing this little gem, for who would have known it to exist?  My coworkers and other acquaintances surely didn't.  I hope that some of you are able to enjoy it with your families, too.",review,8frfhwRITfgjLaDBueU8iA

It's in a strip plaza (across the street from the Fry's on 90th), surrounded by shops catering toward spyware and vitamins. Odd, huh? In any case, you walk in and immediately notice how small the place is. Some may call it quaint - perhaps that's a nicer way of saying ""i could walk the length of the restaurant if I took 50 giant steps."" 

Sushi bar is where to go. The chefs are polite and offer suggestions. Don't expect to be entertained, but do expect to receive your order in a timely fashion. 

You get a clean towel here, too. And prompt beverage service. 3.50 for a Sapporo - you can't go wrong. 

So, is there anything extraordinary about this place? Not really, but perhaps that's why it works. Without the loud music and flashy scene of Scottsdale, you instead find succulent sashima in generous portions, along with a menu that makes you ""hmmm"" and ""uhmmm"" a bit longer than usual. 

Miso soup is medicore (i've had better) and the edamame is refreshing without a thunderstorm of salt - thankfully!

Jazz Roll. Crazy Roll. Shrimp Tempura Roll. How do you decide? When it doubt, just try it all. Or get the Caterpillar Roll - it's made different from other places. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something oddly wonderful about mixing textures - from the softness of the rice and avacado to the crunchyness of the inside. Oh, and eel is divine. So is the extra bonus of shrimp ontop. 

I wouldn't consider this my fave place, and it's definitely not in my neighborhood... but if you live, work or just happen to be in the area, definitely stop into Hiro. You shouldn't leave disappointed, unless you're expecting something other than great food, friendly staff and, lo and behold, a restaurant where you actually hear Japanese spoken by the staff.

The owner of China King, Michael, is very friendly and chatty.  Be Prepared to chat for a few minutes if you strike up a conversation.

The service here was terrific.  We had several people fussing over us but the primary server, Maggie was a gem.  

My wife and the kids opted for the Americanized menu and went with specials like sweet and sour chicken, shrimp in white sauce and garlic beef.  Each came came with soup, egg roll and rice.  I sampled the garlic beef which they prepared with a kung pao brown sauce (a decision Maggie and my wife arrived at after several minutes of discussion) it had a nice robust flavor and the veggies were fresh and flavorful.  I  also sampled the shrimp which were succulent and the white sauce had a little more distinctiveness to it than the same sauce at many Chinese restaurants.

I ordered from the traditional menu but went not too adventurous with sizzling plate with scallops and shrimp in black pepper sauce.  Very enjoyable.  Again, succulent shrimp.  The scallops were tasty as well.  Realizing that I moved here from Boston and I go into any seafood experience with diminished expectations now that I live in the west, I have to say the scallops are among the fresher and judiciously prepared that I have had in Phoenix.

Overall China King delivered a very tasty and very fresh meal.  They have a fairly extensive traditional menu which I look forward to exploring further.

a short drive from the house in my most fashionable dirty yard work clothes and nasty sun hat and the wife and I were enjoying a fabulously cool concoction that is frozen custard. 

there is something strange about custard....it's not frosty cold like ice cream or fro yo, and it's rich and creamy and cold, but doesn't give that cold belly/head feeling. which can be good or bad.

Had I not have to wait 20 minutes for two sandwiches, I'd easily give this meal 4 stars.  Looking over these photos and remembering how good these sandwiches tasted, I'd like to visit again soon, but recalling how long my wait was, and the negative vibes that bounced off the cook (that took my order) and another whom I thought was either an owner or a manager, I am very hesitant on returning.  :(  I did enjoy the sandwiches, especially the cheesesteak, even though half-way through my half-sandwich, I decided it was a little too salty.  I thought the marinara on the parm a great contrast to the rich, creaminess of the cheesesteak and kept me reaching for another bite of the eggplant!

Saturday a few friends and I wanted to go somewhere delicious no one had been and one of them suggested Portlands. I had only been there for drinks a couple times, and loved the bar area, so I figured it would be nice to come back and try some dinner.

One thing that amazes me about this area is how there are always so many cars parked along the road, yet no one is ever in any of the establishments (aside from Fair Trade). Luckily there is the slightly hidden parking deck so we were able to find a spot there. We got there right on time for our reservation. It was very empty when we got there yet it took a good 15 minutes to be seated. I can't say the dining service here is very efficient.

However, there are so many things on their menu I want to try that I can see myself coming back a few times. I started off sharing the scallop appetizer with the butternut squash with a friend and it was so good. The butternut squash was PERFECT and the scallops were mouth watering.

My main dish was the pork with the bourbon apple glaze and the au gratin potatoes and vegetables (I feel horrible that I forget the name). It was just the right amount of food and absolutely delicious. The au gratin potatoes were fabulous and the glaze on that pork was to die for. It had huge apple chunks with it too and omg... so delicious. The vegetables were carrots and two spears of asparagus and I have to admit they weren't the best. I usually kill for asparagus and the carrots tasted better.

The place is nice inside and the waitstaff is comprised of young and beautiful girls. The bar is a bit of a hot spot and the restaurant in general manages to stay busy most of the time.

It's tiny, and stuffed, like it was an after thought, behind a Burger King.  And both of those are in front of this medical complex that makes an L shape around them.
